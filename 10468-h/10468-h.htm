          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            UNCLE JOHN'S DUTY
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You're not doing your duty by those girls, John Merrick!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The gentleman at whom this assertion was flung in a rather angry
            tone did not answer his sister-in-law. He sat gazing reflectively at
            the pattern in the rug and seemed neither startled nor annoyed. Mrs.
            Merrick, a pink-cheeked middle-aged lady attired in an elaborate
            morning gown, knitted her brows severely as she regarded the chubby
            little man opposite; then, suddenly remembering that the wrinkles
            might leave their dreadful mark on her carefully rolled and massaged
            features, she banished them with a pass of her ringed hand and
            sighed dismally.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It would not have mattered especially had the poor children
            been left in their original condition of friendless poverty,&quot;
            she said. &quot;They were then like a million other girls, content
            to struggle for a respectable livelihood and a doubtful position in
            the lower stratas of social communion. But you interfered. You came
            into their lives abruptly, appearing from those horrid Western wilds
            with an amazing accumulation of money and a demand that your three
            nieces become your special <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;es</i>. And what
            is the result?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The little man looked up with a charming smile of good humored
            raillery. His keen gray eyes sparkled as mischievously as a
            schoolboy's. Softly he rubbed the palms of his hands together, as if
            enjoying the situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What is it, Martha, my dear? What is the result?&quot; he
            asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You've raised them from their lowly condition to a sphere in
            which they reign as queens, the envy of all who know them. You've
            lavished your millions upon them unsparingly; they are not only
            presumptive heiresses but already possessed of independent fortunes.
            Ah, you think you've been generous to these girls; don't you, John
            Merrick?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Go on, Martha; go on.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You've taken them abroad&mdash;you took my own daughter, John
            Merrick, and left <i>me</i> at home!&mdash;you've lugged your three
            nieces to the mountains and carried them to the seashore. You even
            encouraged them to enlist in an unseemly campaign to elect that
            young imbecile, Kenneth Forbes, and&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, Martha, Martha! Get to the point, if you can. I'm going,
            presently.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Not until you've heard me out. You've given your nieces every
            advantage in your power save one, and the neglect of that one thing
            renders futile all else you have accomplished.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Now, indeed, her listener seemed perplexed. He passed a hand over
            his shiny bald head as if to stimulate thought and exorcise
            bewilderment.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What is it, then? What have I neglected?&quot; was his mild
            enquiry.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;To give those girls their proper standing in society.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            He started; smiled; then looked grave.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You're talking foolishly,&quot; he said. &quot;Why, confound
            it, Martha, they're as good girls as ever lived! They're highly
            respected, and&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Sir, I refer to Fashionable Society.&quot; The capitals
            indicate the impressive manner in which Mrs. Merrick pronounced
            those words.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I guess money makes folks fashionable; don't it, Martha?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;No, indeed. How ignorant you are, John. Can you not understand
            that there is a cultured, aristocratic and exclusive Society in New
            York that millions will not enable one to gain <i>entr&eacute;e</i>
            to?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, is there? Then I'm helpless.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You are not, sir.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Eh? I thought you said&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Listen, John; and for heaven's sake try for once to be
            receptive. I am speaking not only for the welfare of my daughter
            Louise but for Beth and Patricia. Your nieces are charming girls,
            all three. With the advantages you have given them they may well
            become social celebrities.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;H-m-m. Would they be happier so?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Of course. Every true woman longs for social distinction,
            especially if it seems difficult to acquire. Nothing is dearer to a
            girl's heart than to win acceptance by the right social set. And New
            York society is the most exclusive in America.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm afraid it will continue to exclude our girls, Martha.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Not if you do your duty, John.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That reminds me. What is your idea of my duty, Martha? You've
            been talking in riddles, so far,&quot; he protested, shifting
            uneasily in his chair.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Let me explain more concisely, then. Your millions, John
            Merrick, have made you really famous, even in this wealthy
            metropolis. In the city and at your club you must meet with men who
            have the <i>entr&eacute;e</i> to the most desirable social circles:
            men who might be induced to introduce your nieces to their families,
            whose endorsement would effect their proper presentation.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Nonsense.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It isn't nonsense at all.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Then blamed if I know what you're driving at.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You're very obtuse.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I won't agree to that till I know what 'obtuse' means. See
            here, Martha; you say this social position, that the girls are so
            crazy for&mdash;but they've never said anything to <i>me</i> about
            it&mdash;can't be bought. In the next breath you urge me to buy it.
            Phoo! You're a thoughtless, silly woman, Martha, and let your wild
            ambitions run away with your common sense.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mrs. Merrick sighed, but stubbornly maintained her position.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I don't suggest 'buying' such people; not at all, John. It's
            what is called&mdash;ah&mdash;ah&mdash;'influence'; or, or&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Or 'pull.' 'Pull' is a better word, Martha. Do you imagine
            there's any value in social position that can be acquired by 'pull'?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Of course. It has to be acquired some way&mdash;if one is not
            born to it. As a matter of fact, Louise is entitled, through her
            connection with <i>my</i> family&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Pshaw, I knew <i>your</i> family, Martha,&quot; he
            interrupted. &quot;An arrant lot of humbugs.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;John Merrick!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Don't get riled. It's the truth. I <i>knew</i> 'em. On her
            father's side Louise has just as much to brag about&mdash;an' no
            more. We Merricks never amounted to much, an' didn't hanker to trip
            the light fantastic in swell society. Once, though, when I was a
            boy, I had a cousin who spelled down the whole crowd at a
            spellin'-bee. We were quite proud of him then; but he went wrong
            after his triumph, poor fellow! and became a book agent. Now,
            Martha, I imagine this talk of yours is all hot air, and worked off
            on me not because the girls want society, but because you want it
            for 'em. It's all <i>your</i> ambition, I'll bet a peanut.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You misjudge me, as usual, John. I am urging a matter of
            simple justice. Your nieces are lovely girls, fitted to shine in any
            sphere of life,&quot; she continued, knowing his weak point and
            diplomatically fostering it. &quot;Our girls have youth,
            accomplishments, money&mdash;everything to fit them for social
            triumphs. The winter season is now approaching; the people are
            flocking back to town from their country homes; fashionable gaieties
            and notable events will soon hold full sway. The dear girls are
            surely entitled to enjoy these things, don't you think? Aren't they
            <i>worthy</i> the best that life has to offer? And why shouldn't
            they enter society, if you do your full duty? Once get them properly
            introduced and they will be able to hold their own with perfect
            ease. Give me the credit for knowing these things, John, and try to
            help your nieces to attain their ambition.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But <i>is</i> it their ambition?&quot; he asked, doubtfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;They have not said so in words; but I can assure you it <i>is</i>
            their ambition, because all three are sensible, spirited, young
            women, who live in this age and not the one you yourself knew a half
            century or so ago.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. Merrick sighed and rubbed his head again. Then he slowly rose.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Mornin', Martha,&quot; he said, with a somewhat abstracted nod
            at his sister-in-law. &quot;This is a new idea to me. I'll think it
            over.&quot;
          </p>

            CHAPTER II
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            A QUESTION OF &quot;PULL&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            John Merrick's face was not so cheery as usual as he made his way
            into the city. This suggestion of Martha Merrick's regarding his
            inattention to duty to his beloved nieces was no easy nut to crack.
          </p>
          <p>
            He knew his sister-in-law to be a wordly-minded, frivolous woman,
            with many trivial ambitions; but in this instance he had misgivings
            that she might be right. What did he, John Merrick, know of select
            society? A poor man, of humble origin, he had wandered into the
            infantile, embryo West years ago and there amassed a fortune. When
            he retired and returned to &quot;civilization&quot; he found his
            greatest reward In the discovery of three charming nieces, all
            &quot;as poor as Job's turkey&quot; but struggling along bravely,
            each in her individual characteristic way, and well worthy their
            doting uncle's affectionate admiration. Mrs. Merrick had recited
            some of the advantages they had derived from the advent of this rich
            relative; but even she could not guess how devoted the man was to
            the welfare of these three fortunate girls, nor how his kindly,
            simple heart resented the insinuation that he was neglecting
            anything that might contribute to their happiness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Possession of money had never altered John Merrick's native
            simplicity. He had no extravagant tastes, dressed quietly and lived
            the life of the people. On this eventful morning the man of millions
            took a cross-town car to the elevated station and climbed the stairs
            to his train. Once seated and headed cityward he took out his
            memorandum book to see what engagements he had for the day. There
            were three for the afternoon. At twelve o'clock he had promised to
            meet Von Taer.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;H-m-m. Von Taer.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Gazing reflectively from the window he remembered a conversation
            with a prominent banker some month or so before. &quot;Von Taer,&quot;
            the banker had said, &quot;is an aristocrat with an independent
            fortune, who clings to the brokerage business because he inherited
            it from his father and grandfather. I hold that such a man has no
            moral right to continue in business. He should retire and give the
            other fellow a chance.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why do you call him an aristocrat?&quot; Mr. Merrick had
            enquired.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Because his family is so ancient that it shames the ark
            itself. I imagine his ancestors might have furnished Noah the lumber
            to build his ship. In New York the '400' all kowtow to Von Taer.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Seems to me he has the right to be a broker if he wants to,&quot;
            asserted Mr. Merrick.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;The right; yes. But, between us, Mr. Merrick, this society
            swell has no mental capacity to handle such an uncertain business.
            He's noted for doing unwarranted things. To me it's a marvel that
            Von Taer hasn't shipwrecked the family fortunes long ago. Luck has
            saved him, not foresight.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            That speech of a few weeks ago now seemed prophetic to John Merrick.
            Within a few days the aristocratic broker had encountered financial
            difficulties and been forced to appeal to Mr. Merrick, to whom he
            obtained an introduction through a mutual friend. Von Taer was
            doubtless solvent, for he controlled large means; but unless a
            saving hand was extended at this juncture his losses were sure to be
            severe, and might even cripple him seriously.
          </p>
          <p>
            All this Mr. Merrick shrewdly considered in the space of a few
            moments. As he left the train he looked at his watch and found it
            was barely eleven. He decided not to await the hour of appointment.
            With his usual brisk stride he walked to Von Taer's offices and was
            promptly admitted to the broker's sanctum.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hedrik Von Taer was a fine looking man, tall, grave, of dignified
            demeanor and courteous manners. He stood until his visitor was
            seated and with a gesture of deference invited him to open the
            conversation.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I've decided to make you the loan, Von Taer,&quot; began Mr.
            Merrick, in his practical, matter-of-fact way. &quot;Three hundred
            thousand, wasn't it? Call on Major Doyle at my office this afternoon
            and he'll arrange it for you.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            An expression of relief crossed the broker's face.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You are very kind, sir,&quot; he answered. &quot;I assure you
            I fully appreciate the accommodation.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Glad to help you,&quot; responded the millionaire, briskly.
            Then he paused with marked abruptness. It occurred to him he had a
            difficult proposition to make to this man. To avoid the cold,
            enquiring eyes now fixed upon him he pulled out a cigar and
            deliberately cut the end. Von Taer furnished him a match. He smoked
            a while in silence.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;This loan, sir,&quot; he finally began, &quot;is freely made.
            There are no strings tied to it. I don't want you to feel I'm
            demanding any sort of return. But the truth is, you have it in your
            power to grant me a favor.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Von Taer bowed.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Mr. Merrick has generously placed me under an obligation it
            will afford me pleasure to repay,&quot; said he. But his eyes held
            an uneasy look, nevertheless.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It's this way,&quot; explained the other: &quot;I've three
            nieces&mdash;fine girls, Von Taer&mdash;who will some day inherit my
            money. They are already independent, financially, and they're
            educated, well-bred and amiable young women. Take my word for it.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I am sure your statements are justified, Mr. Merrick.&quot;
            Yet Hedrik Von Taer's face, usually unexpressive, denoted blank
            mystification. What connection could these girls have with the favor
            to be demanded?
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Got any girls yourself, Von Taer?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;A daughter, sir. My only child.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Grown up?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;A young lady now, sir.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Then you'll understand. I'm a plain uneducated man myself.
            Never been any nearer swell society than a Fifth Avenue stage. My
            money has given me commercial position, but no social one worth
            mentioning. Your '400's' a bunch I can't break into, nohow.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            A slight smile hovered over the other's lips, but he quickly
            controlled it.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;They tell me, though,&quot; continued the speaker, &quot;that
            <i>your</i> family has long ago climbed into the top notch of
            society. You're one o' the big guns in the battery, an' hold the
            fort against all comers.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Von Taer merely bowed. It was scarcely necessary to either admit or
            contradict the statement. Uncle John was a little indignant that his
            companion showed no disposition to assist him in his explanation,
            which a clear head might now easily comprehend. So, with his usual
            frankness, he went directly to the point.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'd like my girls to get into the best&mdash;the most select&mdash;circles,&quot;
            he announced. &quot;They're good and pretty and well-mannered, so it
            strikes me they're entitled to the best there is a-going. I don't
            want to mix with your swell crowd myself, because I ain't fit;
            likewise the outfit ain't much to my taste, askin' your pardon; but
            with women it's different. They need to stand high an' shine bright
            to make 'em really happy, and if any special lot is particularly
            ex-clusive an' high-falutin', that's the crowd they long to swarm
            with. It's human nature&mdash;female human nature, anyhow. You catch
            my idea, Von Taer, don't you?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I think so, Mr. Merrick. Yet I fail to see how I can be of
            service to you in gratifying the ambition of your charming nieces.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Then I'll go, and you may forget what I've said.&quot; The
            visitor arose and took his hat from the table. &quot;It was only a
            fool notion, anyway; just a thought, badly expressed, to help my
            girls to a toy that money can't buy.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Hedrik Von Taer gazed steadily into the man's face. There was
            something in the simple, honest self-abnegation of this wealthy and
            important person that won the respect of all he met. The broker's
            stern eyes softened a bit as he gazed and he allowed a fugitive
            smile, due to his own change of attitude, to wreathe his thin lips
            again&mdash;just for an instant.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Sit down, please, Mr. Merrick,&quot; he requested, and rather
            reluctantly Uncle John resumed his seat. &quot;You may not have an
            especially clear idea of New York society, and I want to explain my
            recent remark so that you will understand it. What is called 'the
            400' may or may not exist; but certainly it is no distinct league or
            association. It may perhaps be regarded as a figure of speech, to
            indicate how few are really admitted to the most exclusive circles.
            Moreover, there can be no dominant 'leader of society' here, for the
            reason that not all grades of society would recognize the supremacy
            of any one set, or clique. These cliques exist for various reasons.
            They fraternize generally, but keep well within their own circles.
            Kindred tastes attract some; ancient lineage others. There is an
            ultra-fashionable set, a sporting set, a literary set, an
            aristocratic set, a rather 'fast' set, a theatrical set&mdash;and so
            on. These may all lay claim with certain justice to membership in
            good society. Their circles are to an extent exclusive, because some
            distinction must mark the eligibility of members. And outside each
            luminous sphere hovers a multitude eager to pass the charmed circle
            and so acquire recognition. Often it is hard to separate the
            initiate from the uninitiate, even by those most expert. Is it
            difficult to comprehend such a condition as I have described, Mr.
            Merrick?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Somewhat, Mr. Von Taer. The wonder to me is why people waste
            time in such foolishness.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It is the legitimate occupation of many; the folly of unwise
            ambition impels others. There is a fascination about social life
            that appeals to the majority of natures. Let us compare society to a
            mountain whose sides are a steep incline, difficult to mount. To
            stand upon the summit, to become the cynosure of all eyes, is a
            desire inherent, seemingly, in all humanity; for humanity loves
            distinction. In the scramble toward the peak many fall by the
            wayside; others deceive themselves by imagining they have attained
            the apex when they are far from it. It is a game, Mr. Merrick, just
            as business is a game, politics a game, and war a game. You know how
            few really win.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Here,&quot; said Uncle John, musingly, &quot;is a philosophy I
            did not expect from you, Von Taer. They tell me you're one who
            stands on top the peak. And you were born that way, and didn't have
            to climb. Seems to me you rather scorn the crowd that's trying to
            climb to an eminence you never had to win. That wouldn't be my way.
            And I suspect that if the crowd wasn't trying to climb to you, your
            own position wouldn't be worth a cotton hat.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Von Taer had no answer to this criticism. Perhaps he scarcely heard
            it, for he appeared lost in a brown study. Finally he said:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Will you permit my daughter to call upon your nieces, Mr.
            Merrick?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Of course, sir.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Then kindly give me their addresses.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Uncle John wrote them on a slip of paper.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You may now dismiss the subject from your mind, sir, as you
            lately advised me to do. Whatever may be accomplished in the
            direction you have suggested I will gladly undertake. If I succeed
            it will be exceedingly gratifying to us all, I am sure.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. Merrick left the office in a rather humbled and testy mood. He
            disliked to ask favors at any time and now felt that he had confided
            himself to the mercy of this callous aristocrat and met with a
            distinct rebuff.
          </p>
          <p>
            But he had done it for the sake of his beloved nieces&mdash;and they
            would never know what humiliation this unsatisfactory interview had
            cost him.

            CHAPTER III
          </h2>
          <p>
            DIANA
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Diana Von Taer can not be called a type. She was individual.
            Aristocratic to her finger tips, she was unlike all other
            aristocrats. An admitted queen of society, her subjects were few and
            indifferent. She possessed ancient lineage, was highly accomplished,
            had been born to the purple, as the saying is; but none of these
            things conspired to make her the curious creature she was.
          </p>
          <p>
            As we make her acquaintance she is twenty-three years of age&mdash;and
            looks eighteen. She is tall and slender and carries her handsome
            form with exquisite grace. Diana is never abrupt; her voice is ever
            modulated to soft, even tones; she rises from a chair or couch with
            the lithe, sinuous motion of a serpent uncoiling.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her face, critically regarded, is not so admirable as her form. The
            features are a trifle too elongated, and their delicacy is marred by
            a nose a bit broad and unshapely and a mouth with thin lips primly
            set. Her dark eyes might be magnificent if wide open: but through
            the narrow slits of their lids, half hidden by long curling lashes,
            the eyes peer at you with a cold, watchful, intent gaze that carries
            a certain uncanny and disconcerting fascination.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet the girl is essentially feminine. If you refrain from meeting
            that discomfiting gaze&mdash;and her familiars have learned to avoid
            it&mdash;Diana impresses you as being graceful, dainty and possessed
            of charming manners. Her taste in dress is perfect. She converses
            fluently on many topics. It is her custom to rise at ten o'clock,
            whatever time she may have retired the night before; to read until
            luncheon; to devote the remainder of her day to the requirements of
            society.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eligible young men of admitted social standing call upon Diana at
            such intervals as the proprieties require. They chatter &quot;small
            talk&quot; and are careful to address her with deference. With an
            exception to be referred to later these young men have no more
            thought of &quot;flirting&quot; with Miss Von Taer than they would
            with the statue of the goddess, her namesake. Her dinner parties and
            entertainments are very successful. She is greatly admired, <i>per
            se</i>, but has no intimate friends.
          </p>
          <p>
            When her mother died, some years before, an aunt had come to live
            with Diana, and now posed as her chaperon. Mrs. Cameron was a
            stolid, corpulent lady, with a countenance perpetually placid and an
            habitual aversion to displaying intellect. Her presence in the
            establishment, although necessary, was frankly ignored. Fortunately
            she never obtruded herself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hedrik Von Taer was passionately devoted to his daughter. He alone,
            perhaps, of all the world, thoroughly understood her and appreciated
            her talents. She may have frightened him at times, but that only
            added to his admiration. In return Diana displayed a calm, but
            affectionate regard for her father.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often after dinner these two would pass an hour together in a corner
            of the drawing-room, where the cold gray eyes of the man met the
            intent, half-veiled glance of the girl with perfect understanding.
            They talked of many things, including business. Hedrik had no
            secrets from his daughter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The desperate condition of his finances, when he had been caught in
            a &quot;corner&quot; on wheat and nearly crushed, had not dismayed
            her in the least. It was she who had counseled him to appeal to John
            Merrick, since the name and fame of the eccentric millionaire were
            familiar to her as to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            He related to Diana his interview with Mr. Merrick on his return
            home. He was saved. The three hundred thousand were now in the bank
            to his credit and he could weather the coming storm easily&mdash;perhaps
            with profit. In a tone half amused, half serious, he told her of the
            little millionaire's desire to secure <i>entr&eacute;e</i> into good
            society for his three nieces.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana laughed with her lips; her eyes never laughed. Then she took
            in her hand the paper containing the addresses of the three girls
            and regarded it thoughtfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It is a curious request, <i>mon pere</i>,&quot; she said, In
            her soft, even tones; &quot;but one we cannot diplomatically
            disregard. Provided, however&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes, Diana;&quot; as she paused.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Provided these prospective <i>debutantes</i> are not wholly
            impossible.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I realize that,&quot; returned her father. &quot;John Merrick
            is a great power in the city. He has been useful to me, and may be
            again. I have this chance to win him. But the man is very common
            clay, despite his wealth, and his three nieces are likely to be made
            of the same material. Should they prove impossible you cannot well
            descend to introducing them to our set.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I am not certain of that, sir,&quot; said the girl, with a
            pretty shrug. &quot;My position is too secure to be jeopardized by
            any error of this sort. I believe I may introduce these girls
            without risk. I shall not vouch for them too strongly, and after
            their debut they must stand or fall on their own merits.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It is something a Von Taer has never yet done,&quot; remarked
            the man, gravely.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;To commercialize his social position? But, father dear, the
            age is fast commercializing everything. I think our especial set is
            as yet comparatively free from contamination by the 'lately rich';
            but even among us money has glossed many offenses that a generation
            ago would have meant social ostracism.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            He nodded.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That is true, Diana.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Life with me is a bit dull, as well. Everlasting routine,
            however admirable, is tiresome. I scent amusement in this adventure,
            which I have decided to undertake. With your permission I will see
            these girls and quickly decide their fate. Should they prove not too
            dreadfully <i>outr&eacute;</i> you may look to see them my especial
            <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;s</i>.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I leave all to your discretion, Diana,&quot; returned Von
            Taer, with a sigh. &quot;If, in the end, some of the more particular
            venture to reproach them.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It will not matter,&quot; interrupted the daughter, lightly,
            as her dark eyes narrowed to a hair's breadth. &quot;Any who dares
            reproach Diana Von Taer will afford her interesting occupation. And
            to offset that remote contingency we shall permanently enslave the
            powerful John Merrick. I understand he is hard as nails in financial
            matters; but to us the man has disclosed his one weakness &mdash;ambition
            to promote his three nieces. Since we have discovered this
            vulnerable point, let us take advantage of it. I am satisfied the
            loan of three hundred thousand was but a lure&mdash;and how cleverly
            the man gauged us!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Von Taer scowled.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Get your wraps, Diana. The carriage is waiting, and we are due
            at Mrs. Doldringham's crush.&quot;

            CHAPTER IV
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            THE THREE NIECES
          </p>
          <p>
            The Von Taers did not affect motor cars. In some circles the
            carriage and pair is still considered the more aristocratic mode of
            conveyance. Established customs do not readily give way to fads and
            freaks.
          </p>
          <p>
            Consulting her memoranda as she rode along; in her handsome,
            tastefully appointed equipage, Diana found that Louise Merrick, one
            of the three girls she had set out to discover, was the nearest on
            her route. Presently she rang the bell at the Merrick residence, an
            eminently respectable dwelling; in a desirable neighborhood.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana could not resist a sigh of relief as her observant glance
            noted this detail. A dignified butler ushered her into a reception
            room and departed with her card.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was now that the visitor's nose took an upward tendency as she
            critically examined her surroundings. The furnishings were
            abominable, a mixture of distressingly new articles with those
            evidently procured from dealers in &quot;antiquities.&quot; Money
            had been lavished here, but good taste was absent. To understand
            this&mdash;for Miss Von Taer gauged the condition truly&mdash;it is
            necessary to know something of Mrs. Martha Merrick.
          </p>
          <p>
            This lady, the relict of John Merrick's only brother, was endowed
            with a mediocre mind and a towering ambition. When left a widow with
            an only daughter she had schemed and contrived in endless ways to
            maintain an appearance of competency on a meager income. Finally she
            divided her capital, derived from her husband's life insurance, into
            three equal parts, which she determined to squander in three years
            in an attempt to hoodwink the world with the belief that she was
            wealthy. Before the three years were ended her daughter Louise would
            be twenty, and by that time she must have secured a rich <i>parti</i>
            and been safely married. In return for this &quot;sacrifice&quot;
            the girl was to see that her mother was made comfortable thereafter.
          </p>
          <p>
            This worldly and foolish design was confided to Louise when she was
            only seventeen, and her unformed mind easily absorbed her mother's
            silly ambition. It was a pity, for Louise Merrick possessed a nature
            sweet and lovable, as well as instinctively refined&mdash;a nature
            derived from her dead father and with little true sympathy with Mrs.
            Merrick's unscrupulous schemes. But at that age a girl is easily
            influenced, so it is little wonder that under such tuition Louise
            became calculating, sly and deceitful, to a most deplorable degree.
          </p>
          <p>
            Such acquired traits bade fair in the end to defeat Mrs. Merrick's
            carefully planned <i>coup</i>, for the daughter had a premature love
            affair with a youth outside the pale of eligibility. Louise ignored
            the fact that he had been disinherited by his father, and in her
            reckless infatuation would have sacrificed her mother without
            thought or remorse. The dreadful finale had only been averted by the
            advent of Uncle John Merrick, who had changed the life plans of the
            widow and her heedless daughter and promptly saved the situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            John Merrick did not like his sister-in-law, but he was charmed by
            his lovely niece and took her at once to his affectionate old heart.
            He saw the faults of Louise clearly, but also appreciated her
            sweeter qualities. Under his skillful guidance she soon redeemed
            herself and regained control of her better nature. The girl was not
            yet perfect, by any means; she was to an extent artificial and
            secretive, and her thoughtless flirtations were far from wise; but
            her two cousins and her uncle had come to know and understand her
            good points. They not only bore patiently with her volatile nature
            but strove to influence her to demonstrate her inherent good
            qualities.
          </p>
          <p>
            In one way her mother's calculating training had been most
            effective. Louise was not only a dainty, lovely maid to the eye, but
            her manners were gracious and winning and she had that admirable
            self-possession which quickly endears one even to casual
            acquaintances. She did not impress more intimate friends as being
            wholly sincere, yet there was nothing in her acts, since that one
            escapade referred to, that merited severe disapproval.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course the brilliant idea of foisting her precious daughter upon
            the &quot;select&quot; society of the metropolis was original with
            Mrs. Merrick. Louise was well content with things as they were; but
            not so the mother. The rise from poverty to affluence, the removal
            of all cares and burdens from her mind, had merely fostered still
            greater ambitions. Uncle John's generosity had endowed each of his
            three nieces with an ample fortune. &quot;I want 'em to enjoy the
            good things of life while they're at an age to enjoy 'em,&quot; he
            said; &quot;for the older one gets the fewer things are found to be
            enjoyable. That's my experience, anyhow.&quot; He also told the
            girls frankly that they were to inherit jointly&mdash;although not
            equally&mdash;his entire fortune. Yet even this glowing prospect did
            not satisfy Mrs. Merrick. Since all her plans for Louise, from the
            very beginning, had been founded on personal selfishness, she now
            proposed to have her daughter gain admission to recognized
            fashionable society in order that she might herself bask in the
            reflection of the glory so obtained and take her place with the
            proud matrons who formed the keystone of such society.
          </p>
          <p>
            After carefully considering ways and means to gain her object she
            had finally conceived the idea of utilizing Mr. Merrick. She well
            knew Uncle John would not consider one niece to the exclusion of the
            others, and had therefore used his influence to get all three girls
            properly &quot;introduced.&quot; Therefore her delight and
            excitement were intense when the butler brought up Diana's card and
            she realized that &quot;the perfectly swell Miss Von Taer&quot; was
            seated in her reception room. She rushed to Louise, who, wholly
            innocent of any knowledge of the intrigue which had led to this
            climax, opened her blue eyes in astonishment and said with a gasp:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, mother! what shall I do?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Do? Why, go down and make yourself agreeable, of course. It's
            your chance, my dear, your great chance in life! Go&mdash;go! Don't,
            for heaven's sake, keep her waiting.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise went down. In her most affable and gracious way she
            approached the visitor and said:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It is very nice of you to call upon me. I am <i>so</i> glad to
            meet Miss Von Taer.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana, passing conversational nothings with the young girl, was
            pleased by her appearance and self-possession. This aspirant for
            social honors was fresh, fair and attractive, with a flow of small
            talk at her tongue's end.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Really,&quot; thought the fastidious visitor, &quot;this one,
            at least, will do me no discredit. If she is a fair sample of the
            others we shall get along very nicely In this enterprise.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            To Louise she said, before going:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm to have an evening, the nineteenth. Will you assist me to
            receive? Now that we are acquainted I wish to see more of you, my
            dear, and I predict we shall get along famously together.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The girl's head swam. Help Miss Von Taer to receive! Such an honor
            had been undreamed of an hour ago. But she held her natural
            agitation under good control and only a round red spot Upon each
            cheek betrayed her inward excitement as she prettily accepted the
            invitation. Beneath their drooping lashes Diana's sagacious eyes
            read the thoughts of the girl quite accurately. Miss Von Taer
            enjoyed disconcerting anyone in any way, and Louise was so simple
            and unsophisticated that she promised to afford considerable
            amusement in the future.
          </p>
          <p>
            By the time Diana had finished her brief call this singular creature
            had taken the measure of Louise Merrick in every detail, including
            her assumption of lightness and her various frivolities. She
            understood that in the girl were capabilities for good or for evil,
            as she might be led by a stronger will. And, musingly, Diana
            wondered who would lead her.
          </p>
          <p>
            As for Louise, she was enraptured by her distinguished visitor's
            condescension and patronage, and her heart bounded at the thought of
            being admitted to the envied social coterie in which Diana Von Taer
            shone a bright, particular star.
          </p>
          <p>
            The second name in the list of John Merrick's nieces was that of
            Elizabeth De Graf. She lived at a good private hotel located in an
            exclusive residence district.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was true that Elizabeth&mdash;or &quot;Beth,&quot; as she was
            more familiarly called&mdash;was not a permanent guest at this
            hotel. When in New York she was accustomed to live with one or the
            other of her cousins, who welcomed her eagerly. But just now her
            mother had journeyed from the old Ohio home to visit Beth, and the
            girl had no intention of inflicting her parent upon the other girls.
            Therefore she had taken rooms at the hotel temporarily, and the plan
            suited her mother excellently. For one thing, Mrs. De Graf could go
            home and tell her Cloverton gossips that she had stopped at the most
            &quot;fashionable&quot; hotel in New York; a second point was that
            she loved to feast with epicurean avidity upon the products of a
            clever <i>chef</i>, being one of those women who live to eat, rather
            than eat to live.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mrs. De Graf was John Merrick's only surviving sister, but she
            differed as widely from the simple, kindly man in disposition as did
            her ingenious daughter from her in mental attainments. The father,
            Professor De Graf, was supposed to be a &quot;musical genius.&quot;
            Before Beth came into her money, through Uncle John, the Professor
            taught the piano and singing; now, however, the daughter allowed her
            parents a liberal income, and the self-engrossed musician devoted
            himself to composing oratorios and concertas which no one but
            himself would ever play.
          </p>
          <p>
            To be quite frank, the girl cared little for her gross and selfish
            parents, and they in turn cared little for her beyond the value she
            afforded them in the way of dollars and cents. So she had not lived
            at home, where constant quarrels and bickerings nearly drove her
            frantic, since Uncle John had adopted her. In catering to this
            present whim of her mother, who longed to spend a few luxurious
            weeks in New York, Beth sacrificed more than might be imagined by
            one unacquainted with her sad family history.
          </p>
          <p>
            Whimsical Major Doyle often called Uncle John's nieces &quot;the
            Three Graces&quot;; but Beth was by odds the beauty of them all.
            Splendid brown eyes, added to an exquisite complexion, almost
            faultless features and a superb carriage, rendered this fair young
            girl distinguished in any throng. Fortunately she was as yet quite
            unspoiled, being saved from vanity by a morbid consciousness of her
            inborn failings and a sincere loathing for the moral weakness that
            prevented her from correcting those faults. Judging Beth by the
            common standard of girls of her age, both failings and faults were
            more imaginary than real; yet it was her characteristic to suspect
            and despise in herself such weaknesses as others would condone, or
            at least regard leniently. For here was a girl true and staunch,
            incapable of intrigue or deceit, frank and outspoken, all these
            qualities having been proven more than once. Everyone loved Beth De
            Graf save herself, and at this stage of her development the
            influence of her cousins and of Uncle John had conspired to make the
            supersensitive girl more tolerant of herself and less morbid than
            formerly.
          </p>
          <p>
            I think Beth knew of Diana Von Taer, for the latter's portrait
            frequently graced the society columns of the New York press and at
            times the three nieces, in confidential mood, would canvass Diana
            and her social exploits as they did the acts of other famous
            semi-public personages. But the girl had never dreamed of meeting
            such a celebrity, and Miss Von Taer's card filled her with curious
            wonder as to the errand that had brought her.
          </p>
          <p>
            The De Grafs lived <i>en suite</i> at the hotel, for Beth had
            determined to surround her Sybaritic mother with all attainable
            luxury, since the child frequently reproached herself with feeling a
            distinct repulsion for the poor woman. So to-day Diana was ushered
            into a pretty parlor where Beth stood calmly awaiting her.
          </p>
          <p>
            The two regarded one another in silence a moment, Miss De Graf's
            frank eyes covering the other with a comprehensive sweep while Miss
            Von Taer's narrowed gaze, profoundly observant, studied the
            beautiful girl before her with that impenetrable, half-hidden gleam
            that precluded any solution.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Miss Von Taer, I believe,&quot; said Beth, quietly glancing at
            the card she held. &quot;Will you be seated?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana sank gracefully into a chair. The sinuous motion attracted
            Beth's attention and gave her a slight shiver.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I am so glad to meet you, my dear,&quot; began the visitor, in
            soft, purring accents. &quot;I have long promised myself the
            pleasure of a call, and in spite of many procrastinations at last
            have accomplished my ambition.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Beth resented the affectation of this prelude, and slightly frowned.
            Diana was watching; she always watched.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why should you wish to call upon me?&quot; was the frank
            demand. &quot;Do not think me rude, please; but I am scarcely in a
            position to become a desirable acquaintance of Miss Von Taer.&quot;
            The tone was a trifle bitter, and Diana noted it. A subtile
            antagonism seemed springing up between them and the more experienced
            girl scented in this danger to her plans. She must handle this young
            lady more cautiously than she had Louise Merrick.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Your position is unimpeachable, my dear,&quot; was the
            sweet-toned response. &quot;You are John Merrick's niece.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Beth was really angry now. She scowled, and it spoiled her beauty.
            Diana took warning and began to think quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I referred to my social position, Miss Von Taer. Our family is
            honest enough, thank God; but it has never been accepted in what is
            termed select society.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana laughed; a quiet, rippling laugh as icy as a brook in
            November, but as near gaiety as she could at the moment accomplish.
            When she laughed this way her eyes nearly closed and became
            inscrutable. Beth had a feeling of repulsion for her caller, but
            strove to shake it off. Miss Von Taer was nothing to her; could be
            nothing to her.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Your uncle is a very wealthy man,&quot; said Diana, with easy
            composure. &quot;He has made you an heiress, placing you in a class
            much sought after in these mercenary days. But aside from that, my
            dear, your personal accomplishments have not escaped notice, and
            gossip declares you to be a very fascinating young woman, as well as
            beautiful and good. I do not imagine society claims to be of divine
            origin, but were it so no one is more qualified to grace it.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The blandishments of this speech had less effect upon Beth than the
            evident desire to please. She began to feel she had been ungracious,
            and straightway adopted a more cordial tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I am sure you mean well, Miss Von Taer,&quot; she hastened to
            say, &quot;and I assure you I am not ungrateful. But it occurred to
            me we could have nothing in common.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, my dear! You wrong us both.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Do you know my uncle?&quot; enquired Beth.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;He is the friend of my father, Mr. Hedrik Von Taer. Our family
            owes Mr. John Merrick much consideration. Therefore I decided to
            seek pleasure in the acquaintance of his nieces.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The words and tone seemed alike candid. Beth began to relent. She
            sat down for the first time, taking a chair opposite Diana.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You see,&quot; she said, artlessly, &quot;I have no personal
            inclination for society, which is doubtless so large a part of your
            own amusement. It seems to me artificial and insipid.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Those who view from a distance the husk of a cocoanut, have
            little idea of the milk within,&quot; declared Diana, softly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;True,&quot; answered Beth. &quot;But I've cracked cocoanuts,
            and sometimes found the milk sour and tainted.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;The difference you observe in cocoanuts is to be found in the
            various grades of society. These are not all insipid and artificial,
            I assure you.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;They may be worse,&quot; remarked Beth. &quot;I've heard
            strange tales of your orgies.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana was really amused. This girl was proving more interesting than
            the first niece she had interviewed. Unaccustomed to seeking
            acquaintances outside her own exclusive circle, and under such
            circumstances, these meetings were to her in the nature of an
            adventure. A creature of powerful likes and dislikes, she already
            hated Beth most heartily; but for that very reason she insisted on
            cultivating her further acquaintance.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You must not judge society by the mad pranks of a few of its
            members,&quot; she responded, in her most agreeable manner. &quot;If
            we are not to set an example in decorum to the rest of the world we
            are surely unfitted to occupy the high place accorded us. But you
            must see and decide for yourself.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I? No, indeed!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Ah, do not decide hastily, my dear. Let me become your sponsor
            for a short time, until you really discover what society is like.
            Then you may act upon more mature judgment.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I do not understand you, Miss Von Taer.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Then I will be more explicit. I am to receive a few friends at
            my home on the evening of the nineteenth; will you be my guest?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Beth was puzzled how to answer. The thought crossed her mind that
            perhaps Uncle John would like her to be courteous to his friend's
            daughter, and that argument decided her. She accepted the
            invitation.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I want you to receive with me,&quot; continued Diana, rising.
            &quot;In that way I shall be able to introduce you to my friends.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Beth wondered at this condescension, but consented to receive. She
            was annoyed to think how completely she had surrendered to the will
            of Miss Von Taer, for whom she had conceived the same aversion she
            had for a snake. She estimated Diana, society belle though she was,
            to be sly, calculating and deceitful. Worse than all, she was
            decidedly clever, and therefore dangerous. Nothing good could come
            of an acquaintance with her, Beth was sure; yet she had pledged
            herself to meet her and her friends the nineteenth, lit a formal
            society function. How much Beth De Graf misjudged Diana Von Taer the
            future will determine.
          </p>
          <p>
            The interview had tired Diana. As she reentered her carriage she was
            undecided whether to go home or hunt up the third niece. But Willing
            Square was not five minutes' drive from here, so she ordered the
            coachman to proceed there.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I am positively out of my element in this affair,&quot; she
            told herself, &quot;for it is more difficult to cultivate these
            inexperienced girls than I had thought. They are not exactly
            impossible, as I at first feared, but they are so wholly
            unconventional as to be somewhat embarrassing as <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;es</i>.
            Analyzing the two I have met&mdash;the majority&mdash;one strikes me
            as being transparently affected and the other a stubborn, attractive
            fool. They are equally untrained in diplomacy and unable to cover
            their real feelings. Here am I, practically dragging them into the
            limelight, when it would be far better for themselves&mdash;perhaps
            for me&mdash;that they remained in oblivion. Ah, well: I called it
            an adventure: let me hope some tangible plot will develop to
            compensate me for my trouble. Life seems deadly dull; I need
            excitement. Is it to be furnished by John Merrick's nieces, I
            wonder?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Willing Square is a new district, crowded with fashionable apartment
            houses. That is, they are called fashionable by their builders and
            owners and accepted as such by their would-be fashionable occupants.
            Diana knew at least two good families resident in Willing Square,
            and though she smiled grimly at the rows of &quot;oppressively new
            and vulgar&quot; buildings, she still was not ashamed to have her
            equipage seen waiting there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Number 3708 Willing Square is a very substantial and cozy appearing
            apartment building owned in fee by Miss Patricia Doyle. Diana was
            unaware of this fact, but rang the Doyle bell and ascended to the
            second floor.
          </p>
          <p>
            A maid received her with the announcement that Miss Doyle had &quot;just
            stepped out,&quot; but was somewhere in the building. Would the
            visitor care to wait a few minutes?
          </p>
          <p>
            Yes; Diana decided she would wait. She took a seat in the snug front
            parlor and from her position noted the series of rooms that opened
            one into another throughout the suite, all richly but tastefully
            furnished in homely, unassuming manner.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;This is better,&quot; she mused. &quot;There is no attempt at
            foolish display in this establishment, at any rate. I hope to find
            Miss Doyle a sensible, refined person. The name is Irish.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            A door slammed somewhere down the line of rooms and a high-pitched
            voice cried in excited tones:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I've found a baby! Hi, there, Nunkie, dear&mdash;I've found a
            baby!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Thereupon came the sound of a chair being pushed back as a man's
            voice answered in equal glee:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why, Patsy, Patsy! it's the little rogue from upstairs. Here,
            Bobby; come to your own old Uncle!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;He won't. He belongs to me; don't you, Bobby darlin'?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            A babyish voice babbled merrily, but the sounds were all &quot;goos&quot;
            and &quot;ahs&quot; without any resemblance to words. Bobby may have
            imagined he was talking, but he was not very intelligible.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;See here, Patsy Doyle; you gimme that baby.&quot; cried the
            man, pleadingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I found him myself, and he's mine. I've dragged him here all
            the way from his home upstairs, an' don't you dare lay a finger on
            him. Uncle John!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Fair play, Patsy! Bobby's my chum, and&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Well, I'll let you have half of him, Nunkie. Down on your
            hands and knees, sir, and be a horse. That's it&mdash;Now, Bobby,
            straddle Uncle John and drive him by his necktie&mdash;here it is.
            S-t-e-a-d-y, Uncle; and neigh&mdash;neigh like a horse!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;How does a horse neigh, Patsy?&quot; asked a muffled voice,
            choking and chuckling at the same time.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;'Nee, hee-hee&mdash;hee; hee!'&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Uncle John tried to neigh, and made a sorry mess of it, although
            Bobby shrieked with delight.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then came a sudden hush. Diana caught the maid's voice, perhaps
            announcing the presence of a visitor, for Patsy cried in subdued
            accents:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Goodness me, Mary! why didn't you say so? Listen, Uncle John&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Leggo that ear, Bobby&mdash;leggo!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;&mdash;You watch the baby, Uncle John, and don't let anything
            happen to him. I've got a caller.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana smiled, a bit scornfully, and then composed her features as a
            young girl bustled into the room and came toward her with frank
            cordiality indicated in the wide smile and out-stretched hand.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Pardon my keeping you waiting,&quot; said Patsy, dropping into
            a chair opposite her visitor, &quot;Uncle John and I were romping
            with the baby from upstarts&mdash;Bobby's such a dear! I didn't
            quite catch the name Mary gave me and forgot to look at your card.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I am Miss Von Taer.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Not Diana Von Taer, the swell society girl?&quot; cried Patsy
            eagerly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana couldn't remember when she had been so completely nonplused
            before. After an involuntary gasp she answered quietly:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I am Diana Von Taer.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Well, I'm glad to meet you, just the same,&quot; said Patsy,
            cheerfully. &quot;We outsiders are liable to look on society folk as
            we would on a cage of monkeys&mdash;because we're so very ignorant,
            you know, and the bars are really between us.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            This frank disdain verged on rudeness, although the girl had no
            intention of being rude. Diana was annoyed in spite of her desire to
            be tolerant.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Perhaps the bars are imaginary,&quot; she rejoined,
            carelessly, &quot;and it may be you've been looking at the side-show
            and not at the entertainment in the main tent. Will you admit that
            possibility, Miss Doyle?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Patsy laughed gleefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I think you have me there, Miss Von Taer. And what do <i>I</i>
            know about society? Just nothing at all. It's out of my line
            entirely.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Perhaps it is,&quot; was the slow response. &quot;Society
            appeals to only those whose tastes seem to require it.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And aren't we drawing distinctions?&quot; enquired Miss Doyle.
            &quot;Society at large is the main evidence of civilization, and all
            decent folk are members of it.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Isn't that communism?&quot; asked Diana.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Perhaps so. It's society at large. But certain classes have
            leagued together and excluded themselves from their fellows,
            admitting only those of their own ilk. The people didn't put them on
            their pedestals&mdash;they put themselves there. Yet the people bow
            down and worship these social gods and seem glad to have them. The
            newspapers print their pictures and the color of their gowns and how
            they do their hair and what they eat and what they do, and the poor
            washwomen and shop-girls and their like read these accounts more
            religiously than they do their bibles. My maid Mary's a good girl,
            but she grabs the society sheet of the Sunday paper and reads it
            from top to bottom. I never look at it myself.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana's cheeks were burning. She naturally resented such ridicule,
            having been born to regard social distinction with awe and
            reverence. Inwardly resolving to make Miss Patricia Doyle regret the
            speech she hid all annoyance under her admirable self-control and
            answered with smooth complacency:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Your estimate of society, my dear Miss Doyle, is superficial.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Don't I know it, then?&quot; exclaimed Patsy. &quot;Culture
            and breeding, similarity of taste and intellectual pursuits will
            always attract certain people and band them together in those
            cliques which are called 'social sets,' They are not secret
            societies; they have no rules of exclusion; congenial minds are ever
            welcome to their ranks. This is a natural coalition, in no way
            artificial. Can you not appreciate that, Miss Doyle?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes, indeed,&quot; admitted Patsy, promptly. &quot;You're
            quite right, and I'm just one of those stupid creatures who
            criticise the sun because there's a cloud before it. Probably there
            are all grades of society, because there are all grades of people.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I thought you would agree with me when you understood,&quot;
            murmured Diana, and her expression was so smug and satisfied that
            Patsy was seized with an irresistible spirit of mischief.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And haven't I seen your own pictures in the Sunday papers?&quot;
            she asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Perhaps; if you robbed your maid of her pleasure.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And very pretty pictures they were, too. They showed culture
            and breeding all right, and the latest style in gowns. Of course
            those intellectual high-brows in your set didn't need an
            introduction to you; you were advertised as an example of
            ultra-fashionable perfection, to spur the ambition of those lower
            down in the social scale. Perhaps it's a good thing.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Are you trying to annoy me?&quot; demanded Diana, her eyes
            glaring under their curling lashes.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Dear me&mdash;dear me!&quot; cried Patsy, distressed, &quot;see
            how saucy and impudent I've been&mdash;and I didn't mean a bit of
            it! Won't you forgive me, please, Miss Von Taer? There! we'll begin
            all over again, and I'll be on my good behavior. I'm so very
            ignorant, you know!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana smiled at this; it would be folly to show resentment to such a
            childish creature.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Unfortunately,&quot; she said, &quot;I have been unable to
            escape the vulgar publicity thrust upon me by the newspapers. The
            reporters are preying vultures, rapacious for sensation, and have
            small respect for anyone. I am sure we discourage them as much as we
            can. I used to weep with mortification when I found myself 'written
            up'; now, however, I have learned to bear such trials with fortitude&mdash;if
            not with resignation.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Forgive me!&quot; said Patsy, contritely. &quot;Somehow I've
            had a false idea of these things. If I knew you better, Miss Von
            Taer, you'd soon convert me to be an admirer of society.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'd like to do that, Miss Doyle, for you interest me. Will you
            return my call?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Indeed I will,&quot; promised the girl, readily. &quot;I'm
            flattered that you called on me at all, Miss Von Taer, for you might
            easily have amused yourself better. You must be very busy, with all
            the demands society makes on one. When shall I come? Make it some
            off time, when we won't be disturbed.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana smiled at her eagerness. How nescient the poor little thing
            was!
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Your cousins, Miss Merrick and Miss De Graf, have consented to
            receive with me on the evening of the nineteenth. Will you not join
            us?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Louise and Beth!&quot; cried Patsy, astounded.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Isn't it nice of them? And may I count upon you, also?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Patsy smiled dubiously into the other's face.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Let me out of it!&quot; she said. &quot;Can't you see I'm no
            butterfly?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana saw many things, having taken a shrewd account of the girl
            long before this. Miss Patricia Doyle was short and plump, with a
            round, merry face covered with freckles, hair indisputably red and a
            <i>retrouss&eacute;</i> nose. Also she possessed a pair of wonderful
            blue eyes&mdash;eyes that danced and scintillated with joyous good
            humor&mdash;eyes so captivating that few ever looked beyond them or
            noted the plain face they glorified. But the critic admitted that
            the face was charmingly expressive, the sweet and sensitive mouth
            always in sympathy with the twinkling, candid eyes. Life and energy
            radiated from her small person, which Miss Von Taer grudgingly
            conceded to possess unusual fascination. Here was a creature quite
            imperfect in detail, yet destined to allure and enchant whomsoever
            she might meet. All this was quite the reverse of Diana's own frigid
            personality. Patsy would make an excellent foil for her.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;As you please, my dear,&quot; she said graciously; &quot;but
            do you not think it would amuse you to make your debut in society&mdash;unimpeachable
            society&mdash;and be properly introduced to the occupants of the
            'pedestals,' as your cousins will be?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Patsy reflected. If Beth and Louise had determined to undertake this
            venture why should she hold back? Moreover, she experienced a
            girlish and wholly natural curiosity to witness a fashionable
            gathering and &quot;size up&quot; the lions for herself. So she
            said:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'll come, if you really want me; and I'll try my best to
            behave nicely. But I can't imagine why you have chosen to take us
            three girls under your wing; unless&mdash;&quot; with sudden
            intuition, &quot;it's for Uncle John's sake.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That was it, at first,&quot; replied Diana, rising to go;
            &quot;but now that I've seen you I'm delighted to have you on your
            own account. Come early, dear; we must be ready to receive our
            guests by nine.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Nine o'clock!&quot; reflected Patsy, when her visitor had
            gone; &quot;why, I'm often in bed by that time.&quot;
          </p>

            CHAPTER V
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            PREPARING FOR THE PLUNGE
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            John Merrick lived with the Doyles at their Willing Square
            apartments. There were but two of the Doyles&mdash;Patricia and her
            father, Major Doyle, a tall, handsome, soldierly man with white
            moustache and hair. The Major was noted as a &quot;character,&quot;
            a keen wit and a most agreeable type of the &quot;old Irish
            gentleman.&quot; He fairly worshipped his daughter, and no one
            blamed him for it. His business, as special agent and manager for
            his brother-in-law's millions, kept the Major closely occupied and
            afforded John Merrick opportunity to spend his days as be pleased.
            The rich man was supposed to be &quot;retired,&quot; yet the care of
            his investments and income was no light task, as the Major found.
          </p>
          <p>
            We are accustomed to regard extreme wealth as the result of
            hard-headed shrewdness, not wholly divorced from unscrupulous
            methods, yet no one could accuse John Merrick or his representative
            with being other than kindly, simple-hearted and honest. Uncle John
            says that he never intended to &quot;get rich&quot;; it was all the
            result of carelessness. He had been so immersed in business that he
            failed to notice how fast his fortune was growing. When he awoke to
            a realization of his immense accumulation he promptly retired,
            appointing Major Doyle to look after his investments and seeking
            personal leisure after many years of hard work. He instructed his
            agent to keep his income from growing into more capital by rendering
            wise assistance to all worthy charities and individuals, and this,
            as you may suppose, the Major found a herculean task. Often he
            denounced Uncle John for refusing to advise him, claiming that the
            millionaire had selfishly thrust the burden of his wealth on the
            Major's broad shoulders. While there was an element of truth in this
            the burden it was not so heavy as to make the old soldier unhappy,
            and the two men loved and respected one another with manly
            cordiality.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patricia was recognized as Uncle John's favorite niece and it was
            understood she was to inherit the bulk of his property, although
            some millions might be divided between Beth and Louise &quot;if they
            married wisely.&quot; Neither Uncle John nor the Major ever seemed
            to consider Patsy's marrying; she was such a child that wedlock for
            her seemed a remote possibility.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Sunday afternoon following Diana Von Taer's visit to the three
            nieces found the girls all congregated in Patsy's own room, where an
            earnest discussion was being conducted. That left Uncle John to take
            his after-dinner nap in the big Morris chair in the living room,
            where Major Doyle sat smoking-sulkily while he gazed from the window
            and begrudged the moments Patsy was being kept from him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Finally the door opened and the three girls trooped out.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Huh! Is the conspiracy all cut-an'-dried?&quot; growled the
            Major.
          </p>
          <p>
            Uncle John woke up with a final snort, removed the newspaper from
            his face and sat up. He smiled benignantly upon his nieces.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It's all your fault, sor!&quot; declared Major Doyle,
            selecting the little millionaire as the safest recipient of his
            displeasure. &quot;Your foolishness has involved us all in this
            dreadful complication. Why on earth couldn't you leave well-enough
            alone?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Uncle John received the broadside with tolerant equanimity.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What's wrong; my dears?&quot; he enquired, directing his mild
            glance toward the bevy of young girls.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I am unaware that anything is wrong, Uncle,&quot; replied
            Louise gravely. &quot;But since we are about to make our debut in
            society it is natural we should have many things to discuss that
            would prove quite uninteresting to men. Really, Uncle John, this is
            a great event&mdash;perhaps the most important event of our lives.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Shucks an' shoestrings!&quot; grunted the Major. &quot;What's
            in this paper-shelled, painted, hollow thing ye call 'society' to
            interest three healthy, wide-awake girls? Tell me that!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You don't understand, dear,&quot; said Patsy, soothing him
            with a kiss.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I think he does,&quot; remarked Beth, with meditative brows.
            &quot;Modern society is a man-made&mdash;or woman-made&mdash;condition,
            to a large extent artificial, selfish and unwholesome.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, Beth!&quot; protested Louise. &quot;You're talking like a
            rank socialist. I can understand common people sneering at society,
            which is so far out of their reach; but a girl about to be accepted
            in the best circles has no right to rail at her own caste.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;There can be no caste in America,&quot; declared Beth,
            stubbornly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But there <i>is</i> caste in America, and will be so long as
            the exclusiveness of society is recognized by the people at large,&quot;
            continued Louise. &quot;If it is a 'man-made condition' isn't it the
            most respected, most refined, most desirable condition that one may
            attain to?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;There are plenty of honest and happy people in the world who
            ignore society altogether,&quot; answered Beth. &quot;It strikes me
            that your social stars are mighty few in the broad firmament of
            humanity.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But they're stars, for all that, dear,&quot; said Uncle John,
            smiling at her with a hint of approval in his glance, yet picking up
            the argument; &quot;and they look mighty big and bright to the crowd
            below. It's quite natural. You can't keep individuals from gaining
            distinction, even in America. There are few generals in an army, for
            instance; and they're 'man-made'; but that's no reason the generals
            ain't entitled to our admiration.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Let's admire 'em, then&mdash;from a distance,&quot; retorted
            the Major, realizing the military simile was employed to win his
            sympathy.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Certain things, my dear Major, are naturally dear to a girl's
            heart,&quot; continued Uncle John, musingly; &quot;and we who are
            not girls have no right to condemn their natural longings. Girls
            love dancing, pink teas and fudge-parties, and where can they find
            'em in all their perfection but in high society? Girls love
            admiration and flirtations&mdash;you do, my dears; you can't deny
            it--and the male society swells have the most time to devote to such
            things. Girls love pretty dresses&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, Uncle! you've hit the nail on the head now,&quot;
            exclaimed Patsy, laughing. &quot;We must all have new gowns for this
            reception, and as we're to assist Miss Von Taer the dresses must
            harmonize, so to speak, and&mdash;and&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And be quite suited to the occasion,&quot; broke in Louise;
            &quot;and&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And wear our lives out with innumerable fittings,&quot;
            concluded Beth, gloomily.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But why new dresses?&quot; demanded the Major. &quot;You've
            plenty of old ones that are clean and pretty, I'm sure; and our
            Patsy had one from the dressmaker only last week that's fit for a
            queen.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, Daddy! you don't understand,&quot; laughed Patsy.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;This time, Major, I fear you don't,&quot; agreed Beth. &quot;Your
            convictions regarding society may be admirable, but you're weak on
            the gown question.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;If the women would only listen to me,&quot; began the Major,
            dictatorially; but Uncle John cut him short.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;They won't, sir; they'll listen to no man when it comes to
            dressmaking.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Don't they dress to captivate the men, then?&quot; asked the
            Major, with fine sarcasm.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Not at all,&quot; answered Louise, loftily. &quot;Men seldom
            know what a woman has on, if she looks nice; but women take in every
            detail of dress and criticise it severely if anything happens to be
            out of date, ill fitting or in bad taste.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Then they're in bad taste themselves!&quot; retorted the
            Major, hotly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Tut-tut, sir; who are you to criticise woman's ways?&quot;
            asked Uncle John, much amused. The Major was silenced, but he glared
            as if unconvinced.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Dressmaking is a nuisance,&quot; remarked Beth, placidly;
            &quot;but it's the penalty we pay for being women.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You're nothing but slips o' girls, not out of your teens,&quot;
            grumbled the Major. And no one paid any attention to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;We want to do you credit, Uncle John,&quot; said Patsy,
            brightly. &quot;Perhaps our names will be in the papers.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;They're there already,&quot; announced Mr. Merrick, picking up
            the Sunday paper that lay beside him.
          </p>
          <p>
            A chorus of exclamations was followed by a dive for the paper, and
            even the Major smiled grimly as he observed the three girlish heads
            close together and three pair of eager eyes scanning swiftly the
            society columns.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Here it is!&quot; cried Patsy, dancing up and down like a
            school-girl; and Louise read in a dignified voice&mdash;which
            trembled slightly with excitement and pleasure&mdash;the following
            item:
          </p>

            &quot;Miss Von Taer will receive next Thursday evening at the family
            mansion in honor of Miss Merrick, Miss Doyle and Miss De Graf. These
            three charming <i>debutantes</i> are nieces of John Merrick, the
            famous tin-plate magnate.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Phoo!&quot; growled the Major, during the impressive hush that
            followed; &quot;that's it, exactly. Your names are printed because
            you're John Merrick's nieces. If it hadn't been for tin-plate, my
            dears, society never would 'a' known ye at all, at all!&quot;

            CHAPTER VI
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            THE FLY IN THE BROTH
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Diana was an experienced entertainer and under her skillful
            supervision the reception proved eminently successful. Nor had she
            cause to be ashamed of the three <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;es</i> she
            presented to society, since capable <i>modistes</i> had supplemented
            their girlish charms and freshness with costumes pertinent to the
            occasion. Perhaps Patsy's chubby form looked a little &quot;dumpish&quot;
            in her party gown, for some of Diana's female guests regarded her
            with quiet amusement and bored tolerance, while the same critical
            posse was amazed and envious at Beth's superb beauty and stately
            bearing. After all, it was Louise who captured the woman contingency
            and scored the greatest success; for her appearance was not only
            dainty and attractive but she was so perfectly self-possessed and
            responsive and bore herself so admirably under the somewhat trying;
            circumstances of a debut that she won the cordial goodwill of all
            whom she encountered. The hostess was elaborately gowned in white
            pompadour satin, trimmed with white chiffon and embroidered in pink
            roses and pearls. The Von Taer home was handsomely decorated for the
            occasion, since Diana never did anything by halves and for her own
            credit insisted on attention to those details of display that
            society recognizes and loves. Hundreds of long-stemmed American
            Beauties and Kentia palms were combined in beautifying the spacious
            hall, while orchids in marvelous variety nodded their blossoms in
            the great drawing-room, where the young-ladies received. These rare
            and precious flowers were arranged in bronze baskets with sprays of
            maidenhair. In the music room adjoining, great clusters of Madam
            Chantenay roses embellished the charming scene. Branches of
            cherry-blossoms, supplied by hot-houses, were banked in the lofty
            dining-room, where a Japanese pergola made of bamboo and lighted
            with red lanterns was erected at the upper end. The attendants here
            were Japanese girls in native costume, and the long table was laid
            with a lace cloth over pink satin, with butterfly bows of pink
            tulle. The table itself was decorated with cut-glass baskets of
            Cecil Brunner roses mingled with lilies of the valley and
            refreshments were distributed to the standing guests as they
            entered.
          </p>
          <p>
            The affair was in the nature of a typical &quot;crush,&quot; for
            Diana's list of eligibles included most of the prominent society
            folk then in town, and she was too important a personage to have her
            invitations disregarded. Beth and Patsy were fairly bewildered by
            the numerous introductions, until names became meaningless in their
            ears; but Louise, perfectly composed and in no wise distracted by
            her surroundings or the music of the orchestra and the perpetual
            buzz of conversation in the crowded rooms, impressed each individual
            upon her memory clearly, and was not likely to blunder in regard to
            names or individuality in the future. This is a rare talent, indeed,
            and scores, largely in one's favor; for no one likes to think
            himself so unimportant as to be forgotten, under any circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was during the thick of the reception that one of Miss Von Taer's
            intimates, a graceful blond girl, suddenly seized her arm and
            whispered: &quot;Oh, Diana! Guess who's here&mdash;guess, my dear!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana knew. Her eyes, always narrowed until the lashes shielded
            their sharp watchfulness, seldom missed observing anything of
            importance. She pressed her friend's hand and turned again to the
            line of guests, while Louise, who had overheard the excited whisper,
            wondered casually what it might mean.
          </p>
          <p>
            Soon after she knew. A tall, handsome young fellow was bowing before
            Diana, who&mdash;wonder of wonders!&mdash;for an instant unclosed
            her great eyes and shot an electric glance into his smiling face.
            The glance was brief as unexpected, yet it must have told the young
            man something, for he flushed and bowed again as if to hide his
            embarrassment. It also told Louise something, and her heart, which
            had given a quick bound at sight of the man's face, began to cry out
            against Diana Von Taer's artifices.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Mr. Arthur Weldon,&quot; said the hostess, in her soft voice;
            and now, as the young man turned an eager gaze on Louise and half
            extended his hand, the girl's face grew pale and she imitated Diana
            to the extent of dropping her eyes and bowing with frigid
            indifference.
          </p>
          <p>
            Standing close he whispered &quot;Louise!&quot; in a pleading tone
            that made Diana frown wickedly. But the girl was unresponsive and
            another instant forced him to turn to Beth.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why, Arthur! are you here, then?&quot; said the girl, in a
            surprised but cordial tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That is not astonishing, Miss Beth,&quot; he replied. &quot;The
            puzzling fact is that <i>you</i> are here&mdash;and under such
            auspices,&quot; he added, in a lower tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Patsy now claimed him, with a frank greeting, and Arthur Weldon
            could do little more than press her hand when the line forced him to
            move on and give place to others.
          </p>
          <p>
            But this especial young fellow occupied the minds of all four girls
            long after the crowd had swallowed him up. Diana was uneasy and
            obviously disturbed by the discovery that he was known to the three
            cousins, as well as by the memory of his tone as he addressed Louise
            Merrick. Louise, who had read Diana's quick glance with the accuracy
            of an intuitionist, felt a sudden suspicion and dislike for Diana
            now dominating her. Behind all this was a mystery, which shall be
            explained here because the reader deserves to be more enlightened
            than the characters themselves.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthur Weldon's nature was a queer combination of weakness and
            strength. He was physically brave but a moral coward. The motherless
            son of a man wholly immersed in business, he had been much neglected
            in his youth and his unstable character was largely the result of
            this neglect. On leaving college he refused a business career
            planned for him by his father, who cast him off with scornful
            indifference, and save for a slim temporary allowance promised to
            disinherit him. It was during this period that Arthur met Louise and
            fell desperately in love with her. The girl appeared to return the
            young fellow's devotion, but shrewd, worldly Mrs. Merrick,
            discovering that the boy was practically disinherited and had no
            prospects whatever, forbade him the house. Louise, until now but
            mildly interested in the young-man, resented her mother's
            interference and refused to give him up. She found ways to meet
            Arthur Weldon outside her home, so that the situation had become
            complicated and dangerous when Uncle John seized his three nieces
            and whisked them off to Europe. Young Weldon, under an assumed name,
            followed and attached himself to the party; but John Merrick's
            suspicions were presently aroused and on discovering the identity of
            the youth he forbade him or Louise to &quot;make love&quot; or even
            speak of such a thing during the remainder of the trip.
          </p>
          <p>
            The young fellow, by manly acts on some occasions and grave
            weaknesses on others, won Uncle John's kindly interest. The old
            gentleman knew human nature, and saw much to admire as well as
            condemn in Louise's friend. Beth and Patsy found him a pleasant
            comrade, and after all love-making was tabooed they were quite a
            harmonious party. Finally the sudden death of Weldon's father left
            him the possessor of a fortune. He returned to America to look after
            his newly-acquired business and became so immersed in it that Louise
            felt herself neglected when she came home expecting him to dance
            attendance upon her as before. She treated him coldly and he ceased
            calling, his volatile and sensitive nature resenting such treatment.
          </p>
          <p>
            It is curious what little things influence the trend of human lives.
            Many estrangements are caused by trifles so intangible that we can
            scarcely locate them at all.
          </p>
          <p>
            At first the girl was very unhappy at the alienation, but soon
            schooled herself to forget her former admirer. Arthur Weldon, for
            his part, consoled himself by plunging into social distractions and
            devoting himself to Diana Von Taer, whose strange personality for a
            time fascinated him.
          </p>
          <p>
            The business could not hold young Weldon's vacillant temperament for
            long; neither could Diana. As a matter of fact his heart, more
            staunch than he himself suspected, had never wavered much from
            Louise. Yet pride forbade his attempting to renew their former
            relations. It was now some months since he had seen the girl, and
            his eager exclamation was wrested from him by surprise and a sudden
            awakening to the fact that his love for her had merely slumbered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana, worldly, cold and calculating as was her nature, had been
            profoundly touched by Arthur's devotion to her. Usually young men
            were soon repulsed by her unfortunate personality, which was not
            easily understood. Therefore her intense nature responded freely to
            this admirer's attentions, and if Diana could really love she loved
            Arthur Weldon. He had never proposed to her or even intimated it was
            his intention to do so, but she conceived a powerful desire to win
            him and had never abandoned this motive when he grew cold and
            appeared to desert her. Just now he was recently back from Italy,
            where he had passed several months, and Diana's reception was his
            first reappearance in society. The girl had planned to bring him to
            her side this evening and intended to exert her strongest
            fascinations to lure him back to his former allegiance; so her
            annoyance may be guessed when she found her three <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;es</i>
            seemingly more familiar with the young man than was she herself.
          </p>
          <p>
            At last the line ended and the introductions were complete. The <i>debutantes</i>
            were at once the center of interested groups composed of those who
            felt it a duty or pleasure to show them attention. Diana wandered to
            the music room and waylaid Arthur Weldon, who was just about to make
            his escape from the house, having decided it was impossible to find
            an opportunity to converse with Louise that evening.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm so glad you came, Arthur,&quot; she said, a quick glance
            assuring her they were not overheard. &quot;You landed from the
            steamer but yesterday, I hear.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And came straightway to pay my respects to my old friend,&quot;
            he answered lightly. &quot;Isn't it unusual for you to present <i>debutantes</i>,
            Diana?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You know these girls, don't you, Arthur?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes; I met them in Europe.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And flirted with Miss Merrick? Be honest, Arthur, I know your
            secret.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Do you? Then you know we were merely good friends,&quot; said
            he, annoyed at her accusation.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Of course. You called her 'Louise,' didn't you?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;To be sure. And Patsy called me 'Arthur. You may have heard
            her.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Patsy?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That's Miss Patricia Doyle&mdash;our dear little Patsy.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh. I'm sure you didn't fall in love with <i>her</i>, at any
            rate.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm not so sure. Everybody loves Patsy. But I had no time for
            love-making. I was doing Europe.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Wasn't that a year or so ago?&quot; she asked, realizing he
            was trying to evade further reference to Louise.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And since then?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I've been away the last six or seven months, as you know, on
            my second trip abroad.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But before that&mdash;when you first returned?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;If I remember rightly I was then much in the society of Miss
            Von Taer. Is the catechism ended at last?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes,&quot; she replied, laughing. &quot;Don't think me
            inquisitive, Arthur; I was surprised to find you knew these girls,
            with whom I am myself but lightly acquainted.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yet you introduce them to your very select set?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;To please my father, who wishes to please Mr. Merrick.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I understand,&quot; said he, nodding. &quot;But they're nice
            girls, Diana. You're not running chances, I assure you.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That relieves me,&quot; she replied rather scornfully. &quot;If
            Arthur Weldon will vouch for them&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But I don't. I'll vouch for no one&mdash;not even myself,&quot;
            he declared hastily. She was calmly reading his face, and did not
            seem to approve the text.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Are you as fickle as ever, then, <i>mon cher</i>?&quot; she
            asked, softly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm not fickle, Diana. My fault is that I'm never serious.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Never?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I cannot remember ever being serious; at least, where a girl
            was concerned.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana bit her lips to restrain a frown, but her eyes, which he was
            avoiding, flashed wickedly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That is surely a fault, my Arthur,&quot; was her tender reply.
            &quot;Were you never serious during our quiet evenings together; our
            dances, theatre parties and romps?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That was merely fun. And you, Diana?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, I enjoyed the fun, too. It meant so much to me. I began to
            live, then, and found life very sweet. But when you suddenly left me
            and went abroad&mdash;ah, <i>that</i> was indeed serious.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Her tone was full of passionate yearning. He laughed, trying to
            appear at ease. Some sort of an understanding must be had with Diana
            sooner or later, and she might as well realize at this present
            interview that the old relations could not be restored. His nature
            was not brutal and he disliked to hurt her; moreover, the boy had an
            uneasy feeling that he had been a far more ardent admirer of this
            peculiar girl than any fellow should be who had had no serious
            intentions; yet it would be folly to allow Diana to think she could
            win him back to his former allegiance. No compromising word had ever
            left his lips; he had never spoken of love to her. Yet the girl's
            attitude seemed to infer a certain possession of him which was far
            from agreeable.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having gone so far, he should have said more; but here again his
            lack of moral courage proved his stumbling-block, and he weakly
            evaded a frank expression of his true feelings.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Life,&quot; he began somewhat haltingly, to break the
            embarrassing pause, &quot;is only serious when we make it so; and as
            soon as we make it serious it makes us unhappy. So I've adopted one
            invariable rule: to laugh and be gay.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Then I too will be gay, and together we'll enjoy life,&quot;
            responded Diana, with an effort to speak lightly. &quot;I shall let
            your moods be my moods, Arthur, as a good friend should. Are we not
            affinities?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Again he knew not what to say. Her persistence in clinging to her
            intangible hold upon him was extremely irritating, and he realized
            the girl was far too clever for him to cope with and was liable to
            cause him future trouble. Instead of seizing the opportunity to
            frankly undeceive her he foolishly evaded the subject.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You've been tempting fate to-night,&quot; he remarked with
            assumed carelessness. &quot;Don't you remember that to stand four
            girls in a row is a bad omen?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Only for the one who first winks. Isn't that the way the
            saying goes? I seldom wink, myself,&quot; she continued, smilingly.
            &quot;But I have no faith in ill omens. Their power is entirely due
            to mental fear.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I think not,&quot; said Arthur, glad the conversation had
            taken this turn. &quot;Once I knew a fellow with thirteen letters in
            his name. He had no mental fear. But he proposed to a girl&mdash;and
            was accepted.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            She gave him one of those sudden, swift glances that were so
            disconcerting.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;If you had a middle initial, there would be thirteen letters
            in your own name, Arthur Weldon.&quot;
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            &quot;But I haven't, Diana; I haven't,&quot; he protested, eagerly.
            &quot;And if ever I propose to a girl I'm sure she'll refuse me. But
            I've no intention of doing such a crazy thing, so I'm perfectly
            safe.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You cannot be sure until you try, Arthur,&quot; she replied
            pointedly, and with a start he became conscious that he was again
            treading upon dangerous ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Come; let us rejoin your guests,&quot; said he, offering her
            his arm. &quot;They would all hate me if they knew I was keeping the
            fair Diana from them so long.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Arthur, I must have a good long; talk with you&mdash;one of
            our old, delightful confabs,&quot; she said, earnestly. &quot;Will
            you call Sunday afternoon? Then we shall be quite undisturbed.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            He hesitated.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Sunday afternoon?&quot; he answered.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;All right; I'll come, Diana.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            She gave him a grateful look and taking his arm allowed him to lead
            her back to the drawing-room. The crush was over, many having
            already departed. Some of the young people were dancing in the open
            spaces to the music of a string orchestra hidden behind a bank of
            ferns in the hall.
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise and Beth were the centers of attentive circles; Patsy
            conversed with merry freedom with a group of ancient dowagers, who
            delighted in her freshness and healthy vigor and were flattered by
            her consideration. Mrs. Merrick&mdash;for she had been invited&mdash;sat
            in a corner gorgeously robed and stiff as a poker, her eyes
            devouring the scene. Noting the triumph of Louise she failed to
            realize she was herself neglected.
          </p>
          <p>
            A single glance sufficed to acquaint Diana with all this, and after
            a gracious word to her guests here and there she asked Arthur to
            dance with her. He could not well refuse, but felt irritated and
            annoyed when he observed Louise's eyes fastened upon him in amused
            disdain. After a few turns he discovered some departing ones waiting
            to bid their hostess <i>adieu</i>, and escaped from his unpleasant
            predicament by halting his partner before them. Then he slipped away
            and quietly left the house before Diana had time to miss him.

            CHAPTER VII
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            THE HERO ENTERS AND TROUBLE BEGINS
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Von Taer reception fully launched the three nieces in society.
            Endorsed by Diana and backed by John Merrick's millions and their
            own winsome charms, they were sure to become favorites in that
            admirable set to which they had fortunately gained admittance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Cards poured in upon them during; the succeeding days and they found
            themselves busy returning calls and attending dinners, fetes, bridge
            parties and similar diversions. The great Mrs. Sandringham took a
            decided fancy to Louise, and when the committee was appointed to
            arrange for the social Kermess to be held in December, this
            dictatorial leader had the girl's name included in the list.
            Naturally the favor led to all three cousins taking active part in
            the most famous social event of the season, and as an especial mark
            of favoritism they were appointed to conduct the &quot;flower booth,&quot;
            one of the important features of the Kermess.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mrs. Merrick was in the seventh heaven of ecstatic delight; Uncle
            John declared his three girls were sure to become shining lights, if
            not actual constellations, wherever they might be placed; Major
            Doyle growled and protested; but was secretly pleased to have &quot;our
            Patsy the captain of the dress parade,&quot; where he fondly
            imagined she outclassed all others. All former denunciations of
            society at large were now ignored, even by unimpressive Beth, and
            the girls soon became deeply interested in their novel experiences.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthur Weldon sulked at home, unhappy and undecided, for a day or
            two after the reception. Sunday noon he dispatched a messenger to
            Diana with a note saying he would be unable to keep his appointment
            with her that afternoon. Then he went straight to the Merrick home
            and sent his card to Louise. The girl flushed, smiled, frowned, and
            decided to go down.
          </p>
          <p>
            No one had ever interested her so much as Arthur Weldon. There had
            been a spice of romance about their former relations that made her
            still regard him as exceptional among mankind. She had been asking
            herself, since the night of the reception, if she still loved him,
            but could not come to a positive conclusion. The boy was no longer
            &quot;ineligible,&quot; as he had been at first; even Uncle John
            could now have no serious objection to him. He was handsome,
            agreeable, occupied a good social position and was fairly well off
            in the way of worldly goods&mdash;the last point removing Mrs.
            Merrick's former rejection of Arthur as a desirable son-in-law.
          </p>
          <p>
            But girls are wayward and peculiar in such an <i>affaire du coeur</i>,
            and none of these things might have weighed with Louise had she not
            discovered that Diana Von Taer was in love with Arthur and intended
            to win him. That aroused the girl's fighting instincts, rendered the
            young man doubly important, and easily caused Louise to forget her
            resentment at his temporary desertion of her. Perhaps, she
            reflected, it had partially been her own fault. Now that Arthur
            showed a disposition to renew their friendship, and she might
            promise herself the satisfaction of defeating Diana's ambitions, it
            would be diplomatic, at least, to receive the youth with cordial
            frankness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Therefore she greeted him smilingly and with outstretched hand,
            saying:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;This is quite a surprise, Mr. Weldon. I'd a notion you had
            forgotten me.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;No, indeed, Louise! How could you imagine such a thing?&quot;
            he answered, reproachfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;There was some evidence of the fact,&quot; she asserted
            archly. &quot;At one time you gave me no peace; then you became
            retiring. At last you disappeared wholly. What could I think, sir,
            under such circumstances?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            He stood looking down at her thoughtfully. How pretty she had grown;
            and how mature and womanly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Louise,&quot; said he, gently, &quot;don't let us indulge in
            mutual reproaches. Some one must have been at fault and I'll
            willingly take all the blame if you will forgive me. Once we were&mdash;were
            good friends. We&mdash;we intended to be still more to one another,
            Louise, but something occurred, I don't know what, to&mdash;to
            separate us.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why, you went away,&quot; said the girl, laughing; &quot;and
            that of course separated us.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You treated me like a beggar; don't forget that part of it,
            dear. Of course I went away.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And consoled yourself with a certain Miss Diana Von Taer. It
            has lately been rumored you are engaged to her.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Me? What nonsense?&quot; But he hushed guiltily, and Louise
            noted everything and determined he should not escape punishment.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Diana, at least, is in earnest,&quot; she remarked, with
            assumed indifference. &quot;You may not care to deny that you have
            been very attentive to her.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Not especially so,&quot; he declared, stoutly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;People gossip, you know. And Diana is charming.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;She's an iceberg!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, you have discovered that? Was she wholly unresponsive,
            then?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;No,&quot; he said, with a touch of anger. &quot;I have never
            cared for Diana, except in a friendly way. She amused me for a while
            when&mdash;when I was wretched. But I never made love to her; not
            for a moment. Afterward, why&mdash;then----&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Well; what then?&quot; as he hesitated, growing red again.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I found she had taken my careless attentions in earnest, and
            the play was getting dangerous. So I went abroad.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise considered this explanation seriously. She believed he was
            speaking the truth, so far as he knew. But at the same time she
            realized from her own experience that Arthur might as easily deceive
            himself as Diana in his estimate as to the warmth of the devotion he
            displayed. His nature was impetuous and ardent. That Diana should
            have taken his attentions seriously and become infatuated with the
            handsome young fellow was not a matter to cause surprise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Gradually Louise felt her resentment disappearing. In Arthur's
            presence the charm of his personality influenced her to be lenient
            with his shortcomings. And his evident desire for a reconciliation
            found an echo in her own heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mutual explanations are excellent to clear a murky atmosphere, and
            an hour's earnest conversation did much to restore these two
            congenial spirits to their former affectionate relations. Of course
            Louise did not succumb too fully to his pleadings, for her feminine
            instinct warned her to keep the boy on &quot;the anxious seat&quot;
            long enough to enable him to appreciate her value and the honor of
            winning her good graces. Moreover, she made some severe conditions
            and put him on his good behavior. If he proved worthy, and was
            steadfast and true, why then the future might reward him freely.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana had been making careful plans for her interview with Arthur
            that Sunday afternoon. With no futile attempt to deceive herself as
            to existent conditions she coldly weighed the chances in her mental
            scale and concluded she had sufficient power to win this unstable
            youth to her side and induce him to forget that such a person as
            Louise Merrick ever existed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana was little experienced in such affairs, it is true. Arthur
            Weldon had been her first and only declared admirer, and no one
            living had studied his peculiar nature more critically than this
            observant girl. Also she knew well her own physical failings. She
            realized that her personality was to many repulsive, rather than
            attractive, and this in spite of her exquisite form, her perfect
            breeding and many undeniable accomplishments. Men, as a rule, seldom
            remained at her side save through politeness, and even seemed to
            fear her; but never until now had she cared for any man sufficiently
            to wish to retain or interest him. There were unsuspected
            fascinations lying dormant in her nature, and Miss Von Taer calmly
            reflected that the exercise of these qualities, backed by her native
            wit and capacity for intrigue, could easily accomplish the object
            she desired.
          </p>
          <p>
            Thus she had planned her campaign and carefully dressed herself in
            anticipation of Arthur's call when his note came canceling the
            engagement. After rereading his lame excuse she sat down in a quiet
            corner and began to think. The first gun had been fired, the battle
            was on, and like a wise general she carefully marshaled her forces
            for combat.
          </p>
          <p>
            An hour or two later she turned to her telephone book and called up
            the Merrick establishment. A voice, that of a maid, evidently,
            answered her.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I wish to speak with Miss Merrick,&quot; said Diana.
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise, annoyed at being disturbed, left Arthur's side to respond to
            the call.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Who is it, please?&quot; she asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Is Mr. Weldon still there, or has he gone?&quot; enquired
            Diana, disguising her voice and speaking imperatively..
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why, he's still here,&quot; answered bewildered Louise; &quot;but
            who is talking, please?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            No answer.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Do you wish to speak with Mr. Weldon?&quot; continued the
            girl, mystified at such an odd procedure.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana hung up her receiver, severing the connection. The click of
            the instrument assured Louise there was no use in waiting longer, so
            she returned to Arthur. She could not even guess who had called her.
            Arthur could, though, when he had heard her story, and Diana's
            impudent meddling made him distinctly uneasy. He took care not to
            enlighten Louise, and the incident was soon forgotten by her.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It proved just as I expected,&quot; mused Diana, huddled in
            her reclining' chair. &quot;The fool has thrown me over to go to
            her. But this is not important. With the situation so clearly
            defined I shall know exactly what I must do to protect my own
            interests.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. Von Taer was away from home that Sunday afternoon, and would not
            return until a late hour. Diana went to the telephone again and
            after several unsuccessful attempts located her cousin, Mr. Charles
            Connoldy Mershone, at a club.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It's Diana,&quot; she said, when at last communication was
            established. &quot;I want you to come over and see me; at once.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You'll have to excuse me, Di,&quot; was the answer. &quot;I
            was unceremoniously kicked out the last time, you know.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Father's away. It's all right, Charlie. Come along.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Can't see it, my fair cousin. You've all treated me like a
            bull-pup, and I'm not anxious to mix up with that sort of a
            relationship. Anything more? I'm going to play pool to win my
            dinner.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Funds running low, Charlie?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Worse than that; they're invisible.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Then pay attention. Call a taxi at once, and get here as soon
            as you can. I'll foot the bill&mdash; and any others that happen to
            be bothering you.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            A low, surprised whistle came over the wire.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What's up, Di?&quot; he asked, with new interest.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Come and find out.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Can I be useful?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Assuredly; to yourself.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;All right; I'm on the way.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            He hung up, and Diana gave a sigh of content as she slowly returned
            to her den and the easy chair, where Mr. Mershone found her &quot;coiled&quot;
            some half hour later.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;This is a queer go,&quot; said the young man, taking a seat
            and glancing around with knitted brows. &quot;It isn't so long since
            dear Uncle Hedrik tumbled me out of here neck and crop; and now
            Cousin Diana invites me to return.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            At first glance young Mershone seemed an attractive young fellow,
            tall, finely formed and well groomed. But his eyes were too close
            together and his handsome features bore unmistakable marks of
            dissipation.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You disgraced us a year or so ago, Charlie,&quot; said Diana,
            in her soft, quiet accents, &quot;and under such circumstances we
            could not tolerate you. You can scarcely blame us for cutting your
            acquaintance. But now&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Well, now?&quot; he enquired coolly, trying to read her
            impassive face.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I need the services of just such an unscrupulous and clever
            individual as you have proven yourself to be. I'm willing to pay
            liberally for those services, and you doubtless need the money. Are
            we allies, then?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone laughed, with little genuine mirth.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Of course, my dear cousin,&quot; he responded; &quot;provided
            you propose any legal villainy. I'm not partial to the police; but I
            really need the money, as you suggest.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And you will be faithful?&quot; she asked, regarding him
            doubtfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;To the cause, you may be sure. But understand me: I balk at
            murder and burglary. Somehow, the police seem to know me. I'll not
            do anything that might lead to a jail sentence, because there are
            easier ways to get money. However, I don't imagine your proposed
            plan is very desperate, Diana; it's more liable to be dirty work.
            Never mind; you may command me, my dear cousin&mdash;if the pay is
            ample.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;The pay will be ample if you succeed,&quot; she began.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I don't like that. I may not succeed.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Listen to me, Charlie. Do you know Arthur Weldon?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Slightly; not very well.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I intend to marry him. He has paid me marked attentions in the
            past; but now&mdash;he&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Wants to slip the leash. Quite natural, my dear.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;He has become infatuated with another girl; a light-headed,
            inexperienced little thing who is likely to marry the first man who
            asks her. She is very rich&mdash;in her own right, too&mdash;and her
            husband will be a fortunate man.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone stared at her. Then he whistled, took a few turns up and
            down the room, and reseated himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Evidently!&quot; he ejaculated, lighting a cigarette without
            permission and then leaning back thoughtfully in his chair.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Charlie,&quot; continued Diana, &quot;you may as well marry
            Louise Merrick and settle down to a life of respectability. You've a
            dashing, masterful way which no girl of her sort can long resist. I
            propose that you make desperate love to Louise Merrick and so cut
            Arthur Weldon out of the deal entirely. My part of the comedy will
            be to attract him to my side again. Now you have the entire
            proposition in a nutshell.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            He smoked for a time in reflective silence.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What's the girl like?&quot; he enquired, presently. &quot;Is
            she attractive?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Sufficiently so to fascinate Arthur Weldon. Moreover, she has
            just been introduced in our set, and knows nothing of your shady
            past history. Even if rumors came to her ears, young creatures of
            her sort often find a subtle charm in a man accused of being
            'naughty.'&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Humph!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;If you win her, you get a wife easily managed and a splendid
            fortune to squander as you please.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Sounds interesting, Di, doesn't it? But&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;In regard to preliminary expenses,&quot; she interrupted,
            calmly, &quot;I have said that your reward will be ample when you
            have won the game. But meantime I am willing to invest the necessary
            funds in the enterprise. I will allow you a thousand a month.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Bah! that's nothing at all!&quot; said he, contemptuously, as
            he flicked the ashes from his cigarette.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What do you demand, then?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Five hundred a week, in advance. It's an expensive job, Di.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Very well; I will give you five hundred a week; but only as
            long as you work earnestly to carry out the plot. I shall watch you,
            Charlie. And you must not lose sight of the ultimate reward.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I won't, my sweet cousin. It's a bargain,&quot; he said,
            readily enough. &quot;When do I begin, and what's the program?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Draw your chair nearer,&quot; said Diana, restraining her
            triumphant joy. &quot;I'll explain everything to you in detail. It
            will be my part to plan, and yours to execute.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Good!&quot; he exclaimed, with a cheerful grin. &quot;I feel
            like an executioner already!&quot;
          </p>

            CHAPTER VIII
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            OPENING THE CAMPAIGN
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Louise's little romance, which now began to thrive vigorously, was
            regarded with calmness by her cousins and her mother, who knew of
            the former episode between her and Arthur and attached little
            importance to the renewed flirtation in which they indulged. That
            they were deceived in their estimate was due to the girl's
            reputation for frivolity where young men were concerned. She had
            been dubbed a &quot;flirt&quot; ever since she first began to wear
            long dresses, and her nature was not considered deep enough for her
            heart to be ever seriously affected. Therefore the young girl was
            gravely misjudged.
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise was not one to bare her heart, even to her most intimate
            friends, and no one now suspected that at last her deepest, truest
            womanly affections were seriously involved. The love for Arthur that
            had lain dormant in her heart was aroused at a time when she was
            more mature and capable of recognizing truly her feelings, so that
            it was not long before she surrendered her reserve and admitted to
            him that life would mean little for her unless they might pass the
            years together. For his part, young Weldon sincerely loved Louise,
            and had never wavered from his firm devotion during all the past
            months of misunderstanding.
          </p>
          <p>
            The general impression that they were &quot;merely flirting&quot;
            afforded the lovers ample opportunity to have their walks and drives
            together undisturbed, and during these soulful communions they
            arrived at such a perfect understanding that both were confident
            nothing could ever disturb their trust and confidence.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was at a theatre party that the three <i>debutantes</i> first met
            Charlie Mershone, but they saw little of him that first evening and
            scarcely noticed his presence. Louise, indeed, noted that his eyes
            were fixed upon her more than once with thinly veiled admiration,
            and without a thought of disloyalty to Arthur, but acting upon the
            impulse of her coquettish nature, she responded with a demure smile
            of encouragement.
          </p>
          <p>
            Charlie Mershone was an adept at playing parts. He at first regarded
            Louise much as a hunter does the game he is stalking. Patsy Doyle
            was more jolly and Beth De Graf more beautiful than Miss Merrick;
            but the young man would in any event have preferred the latter's
            dainty personality. When he found her responsive to his admiring
            glances he was astounded to note his heart beating rapidly&mdash;a
            thing quite foreign to his usual temperament. Yes, this girl would
            do very nicely, both as a wife and as a banker. Assuredly the game
            was well worth playing, as Diana had asserted. He must make it his
            business to discover what difficulties must be overcome in winning
            her. Of course Arthur Weldon was the main stumbling-block; but
            Weldon was a ninny; he must be thrust aside; Diana had promised to
            attend to that.
          </p>
          <p>
            Never in his life had Charles Connoldy Mershone been in earnest
            before. After his first interview with Louise Merrick he became in
            deadly earnest. His second meeting with her was at Marie Delmar's
            bridge whist party, where they had opportunity for an extended
            conversation. Arthur was present this evening, but by some chance
            Mershone drew Louise for his partner at cards, and being a skillful
            player he carried her in progression from table to table, leaving
            poor Arthur far behind and indulging in merry repartee and mild
            flirtation until they felt they were quite well acquainted.
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise found the young man a charming conversationalist. He had a
            dashing, confidential way of addressing the girl which impressed her
            as flattering and agreeable, while his spirits were so exuberant and
            sparkling with humor that she was thoroughly amused every moment
            while in his society. Indeed, Mr. Mershone was really talented, and
            had he possessed any manly attributes, or even the ordinary
            honorable instincts of mankind, there is little doubt he would have
            been a popular favorite. But he had made his mark, and it was a
            rather grimy one. From earliest youth he had been guilty of
            discreditable acts that had won for him the contempt of all
            right-minded people. That he was still accepted with lax tolerance
            by some of the more thoughtless matrons of the fashionable set was
            due to his family name. They could not forget that in spite of his
            numerous lapses from respectability he was still a Mershone. Not one
            of the careless mothers who admitted him to her house would have
            allowed her daughter to wed him, and the degree of tolerance
            extended to him was fully appreciated by Mershone himself. He knew
            he was practically barred from the most desirable circles and seldom
            imposed himself upon his former acquaintances; but now, with a
            distinct object in view, he callously disregarded the doubtful looks
            he encountered and showed himself in every drawing-room where he
            could secure an invitation or impudently intrude himself. He made
            frank avowals that he had &quot;reformed&quot; and abandoned his
            evil ways forever. Some there were who accepted this statement
            seriously, and Diana furthered his cause by treating him graciously
            whenever they met, whereas she had formerly refused to recognize her
            cousin.
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise knew nothing at all of Charlie Mershone's history and
            permitted him to call when he eagerly requested the favor; but on
            the way home from the Delmars Arthur, who had glowered at the
            usurper all the evening, took pains to hint to Louise that Mershone
            was an undesirable acquaintance and had a bad record. Of course she
            laughed at him and teased him, thinking he was jealous and rejoicing
            that in Mershone she had a tool to &quot;keep Arthur toeing the
            mark.&quot; As a matter of truth she had really missed her lover's
            companionship that evening, but forbore to apprise him of the fact.
          </p>
          <p>
            And now the great Kermess began to occupy the minds of the three
            cousins, who were to share the important &quot;Flower Booth&quot;
            between them. The Kermess was to be the holiday sensation of the
            season and bade fair to eclipse the horse show in popularity. It was
            primarily a charitable entertainment, as the net receipts were to be
            divided among several deserving hospitals; nevertheless it was
            classed as a high society function and only the elect were to take
            active part in the affair.
          </p>
          <p>
            The ball room at the Waldorf had been secured and many splendid
            booths were to be erected for the sale of novelties, notions and
            refreshments. There were to be lotteries and auctions, national
            dances given by groups of society belles, and other novel
            entertainments calculated to empty the pockets of the unwary.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beth was somewhat indignant to find that she and her cousins, having
            been assigned to the flower booth, were expected to erect a pavilion
            and decorate it at their own expense, as well as to provide the
            stock of flowers to be sold. &quot;There is no fund for preliminary
            expenses, you know,&quot; remarked Mrs. Sandringham, &quot;and of
            course all the receipts are to go to charity; so there is nothing to
            do but stand these little bills ourselves. We all do it willingly.
            The papers make a good deal of the Kermess, and the advertisement we
            get is worth all it costs us.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Beth did not see the force of this argument. She thought it was
            dreadful for society&mdash;really good society&mdash;to wish to
            advertise itself; but gradually she was learning that this was
            merely a part of the game. To be talked about, to have her goings
            and comings heralded in the society columns and her gowns described
            on every possible occasion, seemed the desire of every society
            woman, and she who could show the biggest scrap-book of clippings
            was considered of highest importance..
          </p>
          <p>
            Uncle John laughed joyously when told that the expenses of the
            flower booth would fall on the shoulders of his girls and there was
            no later recompense.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why not?&quot; he cried. &quot;Mustn't we pay the fiddler if
            we dance?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It's a hold-up game,&quot; declared Beth, angrily. &quot;I'll
            have nothing to do with it.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes, you will, my dear,&quot; replied her uncle; &quot;and to
            avoid separating you chicks from your pin-money I'm going to stand
            every cent of the expense myself. Why, it's for charity, isn't it?
            Charity covers a multitude of sins, and I'm just a miserable sinner
            that needs a bath-robe to snuggle in. How can the poor be better
            served than by robbing the rich? Go ahead, girls, and rig up the
            swellest booth that money will build. I'll furnish as many flowers
            as you can sell, and Charity ought to get a neat little nest-egg out
            of the deal.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That's nice of you,&quot; said Patsy, kissing him; &quot;but
            it's an imposition, all the same.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It's a blessing, my dear. It will help a bit to ease off that
            dreadful income that threatens to crush me,&quot; he rejoined,
            smiling at them. And the nieces made no further protest, well
            knowing the kindly old gentleman would derive untold pleasure in
            carrying out his generous plans.
          </p>
          <p>
            The flower booth, designed by a famous architect, proved a splendid
            and most imposing structure. It was capped by a monster bouquet of
            artificial orchids in <i>papier-mach&eacute;,</i> which reached
            twenty feet into the air. The three cousins had their gowns
            especially designed for the occasion. Beth represented a lily,
            Louise a Gold-of-Ophir rose, and Patricia a pansy.

            The big ball room had been turned over to the society people several
            days in advance, that the elaborate preparations might be completed
            in time, and during this period groups of busy, energetic young
            folks gathered by day and in the evenings, decorating, flirting,
            rehearsing the fancy dances, and amusing themselves generally.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthur Weldon was there to assist Uncle John's nieces; but his
            pleasure was somewhat marred by the persistent presence of Charlie
            Mershone, who, having called once or twice upon Louise, felt at
            liberty to attach himself to her party. The ferocious looks of his
            rival were ignored by this designing young man and he had no
            hesitation in interrupting a <i>t&ecirc;te-&agrave;-t&ecirc;te</i>
            to monopolize the girl for himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise was amused, thinking it fun to worry Arthur by flirting
            mildly with Mr. Mershone, for whom she cared not a jot. Both Patsy
            and Beth took occasion to remonstrate with her for this folly, for
            having known Weldon for a long time and journeyed with him through a
            part of Europe, they naturally espoused his cause, liking him as
            much as they intuitively disliked Mershone.
          </p>
          <p>
            One evening Arthur, his patience well-nigh exhausted, talked
            seriously with Louise.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;This fellow Mershone,&quot; said he, &quot;is a bad egg, a
            despicable son of a decadent family. His mother was Hedrik Von
            Taer's sister, but the poor thing has been dead many years. Not long
            ago Charlie was tabooed by even the rather fast set he belonged to,
            and the Von Taers, especially, refused to recognize their relative.
            Now he seems to go everywhere again. I don't know what has caused
            the change, I'm sure.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why, he has reformed,&quot; declared Louise; &quot;Diana told
            me so. She said he had been a bit wild, as all young men are; but
            now his behavior is irreproachable.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I don't believe a word of it,&quot; insisted Arthur. &quot;Mershone
            is a natural cad; he's been guilty of all sorts of dirty tricks, and
            is capable of many more. If you'll watch out, Louise, you'll see
            that all the girls are shy of being found in his society, and all
            the chaperons cluck to their fledglings the moment the hawk appears.
            You're a novice in society just yet, my dear, and it won't do you
            any good to encourage Charlie Mershone, whom everyone else avoids.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;He's very nice,&quot; returned Louise, lightly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes; he must be nicer than I am,&quot; admitted the young man,
            glumly, and thereupon he became silent and morose and Louise found
            her evening spoiled.
          </p>
          <p>
            The warning did not fall on barren ground, however. In the seclusion
            of her own room the girl thought it all over and decided she had
            teased her true lover enough. Arthur had not scolded or reproached
            her, despite his annoyance, and she had a feeling that his judgment
            of Charlie Mershone was quite right. Although the latter was
            evidently madly in love with her the girl had the discretion to see
            how selfish and unrestrained was his nature, and once or twice he
            had already frightened her by his impetuosity. She decided to
            retreat cautiously but positively from further association with him,
            and at once began to show the young man coolness.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone must have been chagrined, but he did not allow Louise to
            see there was any change in their relations as far as he was
            concerned. He merely redoubled his attentions, sending her flowers
            and bonbons daily, accompanied by ardently worded but respectful
            notes. Really, Louise was in a quandary, and she frankly admitted to
            Arthur that she had brought this embarrassment upon herself. Yet
            Arthur could do or say little to comfort her. He longed secretly to
            &quot;punch Mershone's head,&quot; but could find no occasion for
            such decided action.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana, during this time, treated both Arthur and Louise with marked
            cordiality. Believing her time would come to take part in the comedy
            she refrained from interfering prematurely with the progress of
            events. She managed to meet her accomplice at frequent intervals and
            was pleased that there was no necessity to urge Charlie to do his
            utmost in separating the lovers.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm bound to win, Di,&quot; he said grimly, &quot;for I love
            the girl even better than I do her fortune. And of one thing you may
            rest assured; Weldon shall never marry her.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What will you do?&quot; asked Diana, curiously.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Anything! Everything that is necessary to accomplish my
            purpose.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Be careful,&quot; said she warningly. &quot;Keep a cool head,
            Charlie, and don't do anything foolish. Still&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Well?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;If it is necessary to take a few chances, do it. Arthur Weldon
            must not marry Louise Merrick!&quot;

            CHAPTER IX
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            THE VON TAER PEARLS
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Uncle John really had more fun out of the famous Kermess than anyone
            else. The preparations gave him something to do, and he enjoyed
            doing&mdash;openly, as well as in secret ways. Having declared that
            he would stock the flower booth at his own expense, he confided to
            no one his plans. The girls may have thought he would merely leave
            orders with a florist; but that was not the Merrick way of doing
            things. Instead, he visited the most famous greenhouses within a
            radius of many miles, contracting for all the floral blooms that art
            and skill could produce. The Kermess was to be a three days' affair,
            and each day the floral treasures of the cast were delivered in
            reckless profusion at the flower booth, which thus became the center
            of attraction and the marvel of the public. The girls were delighted
            to be able to dispense such blooms, and their success as saleswomen
            was assured at once.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course the fair vendors were ignorant of the value of their
            wares, for Uncle John refused to tell them how extravagant he had
            been; so they were obliged to guess at the sums to be demanded and
            in consequence sold priceless orchids and rare hothouse flora at
            such ridiculous rates that Mr. Merrick chuckled with amusement until
            he nearly choked.
          </p>
          <p>
            The public being &quot;cordially invited&quot; Uncle John was
            present on that first important evening, and &mdash;wonder of
            wonders&mdash;was arrayed in an immaculate full-dress suit that
            fitted his chubby form like the skin of a banana. Mayor Doyle,
            likewise disguised, locked arms with his brother-in-law and stalked
            gravely among the throng; but neither ever got to a point in the big
            room where the flower booth was not in plain sight. The Major's
            pride in &quot;our Patsy&quot; was something superb; Uncle John was
            proud of all three of his nieces. As the sale of wares was for the
            benefit of charity these old fellows purchased liberally&mdash;mostly
            flowers and had enough parcels sent home to fill a delivery wagon.
          </p>
          <p>
            One disagreeable incident, only, marred this otherwise successful
            evening&mdash;successful especially for the three cousins, whose
            beauty and grace won the hearts of all.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana Von Taer was stationed in the &quot;Hindoo Booth,&quot; and
            the oriental costume she wore exactly fitted her sensuous style of
            beauty. To enhance its effect she had worn around her neck the
            famous string of Von Taer pearls, a collection said to be unmatched
            in beauty and unequaled in value in all New York.
          </p>
          <p>
            The &quot;Hindoo Booth&quot; was near enough to the &quot;Flower
            Booth&quot; for Diana to watch the cousins, and the triumph of her
            late <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;es</i> was very bitter for her to
            endure. Especially annoying was it to find Arthur Weldon devoting
            himself assiduously to Louise, who looked charming in her rose gown
            and favored Arthur in a marked way, although Charlie Mershone,
            refusing to be ignored, also leaned over the counter of the booth
            and chatted continually, striving to draw Miss Merrick's attention
            to himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            Forced to observe all this, Diana soon lost her accustomed coolness.
            The sight of the happy faces of Arthur and Louise aroused all the
            rancor and subtile wit that she possessed, and she resolved upon an
            act that she would not before have believed herself capable of.
            Leaning down, she released the catch of the famous pearls and
            unobserved concealed them in a handkerchief. Then, leaving her
            booth, she sauntered slowly over to the floral display, which was
            surrounded for the moment by a crowd of eager customers. Many of the
            vases and pottery jars which had contained flowers now stood empty,
            and just before the station of Louise Merrick the stock was sadly
            depleted. This was, of course, offset by the store of money in the
            little drawer beside the fair sales-lady, and Louise, having greeted
            Diana with a smile and nod, turned to renew her conversation with
            the young men besieging her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana leaned gracefully over the counter, resting the hand
            containing the handkerchief over the mouth of an empty Doulton vase&mdash;empty
            save for the water which had nourished the flowers. At the same time
            she caught Louise's eye and with a gesture brought the girl to her
            side.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Those young men are wealthy,&quot; she said, carelessly, her
            head close to that of Louise. &quot;Make them pay well for their
            purchases, my dear.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I can't rob them, Diana,&quot; was the laughing rejoinder.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But it is your duty to rob, at a Kermess, and in the interests
            of charity,&quot; persisted Diana, maintaining her voice at a
            whisper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise was annoyed.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Thank you,&quot; she said, and went back to the group awaiting
            her.
          </p>
          <p>
            The floral booth was triangular, Beth officiated at one of the three
            sides, Patsy at another, and Louise at the third. Diana now passed
            softly around the booth, interchanging a word with the other two
            girls, after which she returned to her own station.
          </p>
          <p>
            Presently, while chatting with a group of acquaintances, she
            suddenly clasped her throat and assuming an expression of horror
            exclaimed:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;My pearls!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What, the Von Taer pearls?&quot; cried one.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;The Von Taer pearls,&quot; said Diana, as if dazed by her
            misfortune.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And you've lost them, dear?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;They're lost!&quot; she echoed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Well, there was excitement then, you may be sure. One man hurried to
            notify the door-keeper and the private detective employed oh all
            such occasions, while others hastily searched the booth &mdash;of
            course in vain. Diana seemed distracted and the news spread quickly
            through the assemblage.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Have you left this booth at all?&quot; asked a quiet voice,
            that of the official whose business it was to investigate.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I&mdash;I merely walked over to the floral booth opposite, and
            exchanged a word with Miss Merrick, and the others there,&quot; she
            explained.
          </p>
          <p>
            The search was resumed, and Charlie Mershone sauntered over.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What's this, Di? Lost the big pearls, I hear,&quot; he said.
          </p>
          <p>
            She took him aside and whispered something to him. He nodded and
            returned at once to the flower booth, around which a crowd of
            searchers now gathered, much to the annoyance of Louise and her
            cousins.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It's all foolishness, you know,&quot; said Uncle John, to the
            Major, confidentially. &quot;If the girl really dropped her pearls
            some one has picked them up, long ago.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Young Mershone seemed searching the floral booth as earnestly as the
            others, and awkwardly knocked the Doulton vase from the shelf with
            his elbow. It smashed to fragments and in the pool of water on the
            floor appeared the missing pearls.
          </p>
          <p>
            There was an awkward silence for a moment, while all eyes turned
            curiously upon Louise, who served this side of the triangle. The
            girl appeared turned to stone as she gazed down at the gems.
            Mershone laughed disagreeably and picked up the recovered treasure,
            which Diana ran forward and seized.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;H-m-m!&quot; said the detective, with a shrug; &quot;this is a
            strange occurrence&mdash;a very strange occurrence, indeed. Miss Von
            Taer, do you wish&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;No!&quot; exclaimed Diana, haughtily. &quot;I accuse no one.
            It is enough that an accident has restored to me the heirloom.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Stiffly she marched back to her own booth, and the crowd quietly
            dispersed, leaving only Arthur, Uncle John and the Major standing to
            support Louise and her astonished cousins.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why, confound it!&quot; cried the little millionaire, with a
            red face, &quot;does the jade mean to insinuate&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Not at all, sor,&quot; interrupted the Major, sternly; &quot;her
            early education has been neglected, that's all.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Come dear,&quot; pleaded Arthur to Louise; &quot;let us go
            home.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;By no means!&quot; announced Beth, positively; &quot;let us
            stay where we belong. Why, we're not half sold out yet!&quot;

            MISLED
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Arthur Weldon met Mershone at a club next afternoon. &quot;You low
            scoundrel!&quot; he exclaimed. &quot;It was <i>your</i> trick to
            accuse Miss Merrick of a theft last night.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Was she accused?&quot; enquired the other, blandly. &quot;I
            hadn't heard, really.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You did it yourself!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Dear me!&quot; said Mershone, deliberately lighting a
            cigarette.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You or your precious cousin&mdash;you're both alike,&quot;
            declared Arthur, bitterly. &quot;But you have given us wisdom,
            Mershone. We'll see you don't trick us again.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The young man stared at him, between puffs of smoke.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It occurs to me, Weldon, that you're becoming insolent. It
            won't do, my boy. Unless you guard your tongue&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Bah! Resent it, if you dare; you coward.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Coward?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes. A man who attacks an innocent girl is a coward. And
            you've been a coward all your life, Mershone, for one reason or
            another. No one believes in your pretended reform. But I want to
            warn you to keep away from Miss Merrick, hereafter, or I'll take a
            hand in your punishment myself.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            For a moment the two eyed one another savagely. They were equally
            matched in physique; but Arthur was right, there was no fight in
            Mershone; that is, of the knock-down order. He would fight in his
            own way, doubtless, and this made him more dangerous than his
            antagonist supposed.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What right have you, sir, to speak for Miss Merrick?&quot; he
            demanded.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;The best right in the world,&quot; replied Arthur. &quot;She
            is my promised wife.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Indeed! Since when?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That is none of your affair, Mershone. As a matter of fact,
            however, that little excitement you created last night resulted in a
            perfect understanding between us.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;<i>I</i> created!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You, of course. Miss Merrick does not care to meet you again.
            You will do well to avoid her in the future.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I don't believe you, Weldon. You're bluffing.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Am I? Then dare to annoy Miss Merrick again and I'll soon
            convince you of my sincerity.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            With this parting shot he walked away, leaving Mershone really at a
            loss to know whether he was in earnest or not. To solve the question
            he called a taxicab and in a few minutes gave his card to the
            Merrick butler with a request to see Miss Louise.
          </p>
          <p>
            The man returned with a message that Miss Merrick was engaged.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Please tell her it is important,&quot; insisted Mershone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again the butler departed, and soon returned.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Any message for Miss Merrick must be conveyed in writing, sir,&quot;
            he said, &quot;She declines to see you.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone went away white with anger. We may credit him with loving
            Louise as intensely as a man of his caliber can love anyone. His
            sudden dismissal astounded him and made him frantic with
            disappointment. Louise's treatment of the past few days might have
            warned him, but he had no intuition of the immediate catastrophe
            that had overtaken him. It wasn't his self-pride that was injured;
            that had become so battered there was little of it left; but he had
            set his whole heart on winning this girl and felt that he could not
            give her up.
          </p>
          <p>
            Anger toward Weldon was prominent amongst his emotion. He declared
            between his set teeth that if Louise was lost to him she should
            never marry Weldon. Not on Diana's account, but for his own vengeful
            satisfaction was this resolve made.
          </p>
          <p>
            He rode straight to his cousin and told her the news. The statement
            that Arthur was engaged to marry Louise Merrick drove her to a wild
            anger no less powerful because she restrained any appearance of it.
            Surveying her cousin steadily through her veiled lashes she asked:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Is there no way we can prevent this thing?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone stalked up and down before her like a caged beast. His eyes
            were red and wicked; his lips were pressed tightly together.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Diana,&quot; said he, &quot;I've never wanted anything in this
            world as I want that girl. I can't let that mollycoddle marry her!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            She flushed, and then frowned. It was not pleasant to hear the man
            of her choice spoken of with such contempt, but after all their
            disappointment and desires were alike mutual and she could not break
            with Charlie at this juncture.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly he paused and asked:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Do you still own that country home near East Orange?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes; but we never occupy it now. Father does not care for the
            place.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Is it deserted?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Practically so. Madame Cerise is there in charge.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Old Cerise? I was going to ask you what had become of that
            clever female.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;She was too clever, Charlie. She knew too much of our affairs,
            and was always prying into things that did not concern her. So
            father took an antipathy to the poor creature, and because she has
            served our family for so long sent her to care for the house at East
            Orange.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Pensioned her, eh? Well, this is good news, Di; perhaps the
            best news in the world. I believe it will help clear up the
            situation. Old Cerise and I always understood each other.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Will you explain?&quot; asked Diana, coldly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I think not, my fair cousin. I prefer to keep my own counsel.
            You made a bad mess of that little deal last night, and are
            responsible for the climax that faces us. Besides, a woman is never
            a good conspirator. I know what you want; and I know what I want. So
            I'll work this plan alone, if you please. And I'll win, Di; I'll win
            as sure as fate&mdash;if you'll help me.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You ask me to help you and remain in the dark?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes; it's better so. Write me a note to Cerise and tell her to
            place the house and herself unreservedly at my disposal.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            She stared at him fixedly, and he returned the look with an evil
            smile. So they sat in silence a moment. Then slowly she arose and
            moved to her escritoire, drawing a sheet of paper toward her and
            beginning to write.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Is there a telephone at the place?&quot; enquired Mershone
            abruptly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Then telephone Cerise after I'm gone. That will make it doubly
            sure. And give me the number, too, so I can jot it down. I may need
            it.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana quietly tore up the note.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;The telephone is better,&quot; she said. &quot;Being in the
            dark, sir, I prefer not to commit myself in writing.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You're quite right, Di,&quot; he exclaimed, admiringly. &quot;But
            for heaven's sake don't forget to telephone Madame Cerise.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I won't Charlie. And, see here, keep your precious plans to
            yourself, now and always. I intend to know nothing of what you do.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm merely the cats-paw, eh? Well, never mind. Is old Cerise
            to be depended upon, do you think?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why not?&quot; replied the girl. &quot;Cerise belongs to the
            Von Taers&mdash;body and soul!&quot;
          </p>

            CHAPTER XI
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            THE BROWN LIMOUSINE
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The second evening of the society Kermess passed without unusual
            event and proved very successful in attracting throngs of
            fashionable people to participate in its pleasures.
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise and her cousins were at their stations early, and the second
            installment of Uncle John's flowers was even more splendid and
            profuse than the first. It was not at all difficult to make sales,
            and the little money drawer began to bulge with its generous
            receipts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Many a gracious smile or nod or word was bestowed upon Miss Merrick
            by the society folk; for these people had had time to consider the
            accusation against her implied by Diana Von Taer's manner when the
            pearls were discovered in the empty flower vase. Being rather
            impartial judges&mdash;for Diana was not a popular favorite with her
            set&mdash;they decided it was absurd to suppose a niece of wealthy
            old John Merrick would descend to stealing any one's jewelry. Miss
            Merrick might have anything her heart desired with-out pausing to
            count the cost, and moreover she was credited with sufficient common
            sense to realize that the Von Taer heirlooms might easily be
            recognized anywhere. So a little gossip concerning the queer
            incident had turned the tide of opinion in Louise's favor, and as
            she was a recent <i>debutante</i> with a charming personality all
            vied to assure her she was held blameless.
          </p>
          <p>
            A vast coterie of the select hovered about the flower booth all the
            evening, and the cousins joyously realized they had scored one of
            the distinct successes of the Kermess. Arthur could not get very
            close to Louise this evening; but he enjoyed her popularity and from
            his modest retirement was able to exchange glances with her at
            intervals, and these glances assured him he was seldom absent from
            her thoughts.
          </p>
          <p>
            Aside from this, he had the pleasure of glowering ferociously upon
            Charlie Mershone, who, failing to obtain recognition from Miss
            Merrick, devoted himself to his cousin Diana, or at least lounged
            nonchalantly in the neighborhood of the Hindoo Booth. Mershone was
            very quiet. There was a speculative look upon his features that
            denoted an undercurrent of thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana's face was as expressionless as ever. She well knew her action
            of the previous evening had severed the cordial relations formerly
            existing between her and Mr. Merrick's nieces, and determined to
            avoid the possibility of a snub by keeping aloof from them. She
            greeted whoever approached her station in her usual gracious and
            cultured manner, and refrained from even glancing toward Louise.
          </p>
          <p>
            Hedrik Von Taer appeared for an hour this evening. He quietly
            expressed his satisfaction at the complete arrangements of the
            Kermess, chatted a moment with his daughter, and then innocently
            marched over to the flower booth and made a liberal purchase from
            each of the three girls. Evidently the old gentleman had no inkling
            of the incident of the previous evening, or that Diana was not still
            on good terms with the young ladies she had personally introduced to
            society. His action amused many who noted it, and Louise blushing
            but thoroughly self-possessed, exchanged her greetings with Diana's
            father and thanked him heartily for his purchase. Mr. Von Taer
            stared stonily at Charlie Mershone, but did not speak to him.
          </p>
          <p>
            Going out he met John Merrick, and the two men engaged in
            conversation most cordially.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You did the trick all right, Von Taer,&quot; said the little
            millionaire, &quot;and I'm much obliged, as you may suppose. You're
            not ashamed of my three nieces, I take it?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Your nieces, Mr. Merrick, are very charming young women,&quot;
            was the dignified reply. &quot;They will grace any station in life
            to which they may be called.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            When the evening's entertainment came to an end Arthur Weldon took
            Louise home in his new brown limousine, leaving Patsy and her
            father, Uncle John and Beth to comfortably fill the Doyle motor car.
            Now that the engagement of the young people had been announced and
            accepted by their friends, it seemed very natural for them to prefer
            their own society.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What do you think of it, Uncle John, anyhow?&quot; asked
            Patsy, as they rode home.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It's all right, dear,&quot; he announced, with a sigh. &quot;I
            hate to see my girls take the matrimonial dive, but I guess they've
            got to come to it, sooner or later.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Later, for me,&quot; laughed Patsy.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;As for young Weldon,&quot; continued Mr. Merrick,
            reflectively, &quot;he has some mighty good points, as I found out
            long ago. Also he has some points that need filing down. But I guess
            he'll average up with most young men, and Louise seems to like him.
            So let's try to encourage 'em to be happy; eh, my dears?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Louise,&quot; said Beth, slowly, &quot;is no more perfect than
            Arthur. They both have faults which time may eradicate, and as at
            present they are not disposed to be hypercritical they ought to get
            along nicely together.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;If 't was me,&quot; said the Major, oracularly, &quot;I'd
            never marry Weldon.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;He won't propose to you, Daddy dear,&quot; returned Patsy,
            mischievously; &quot;he prefers Louise.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I decided long ago,&quot; said Uncle John, &quot;that&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            I'd never be allowed to pick out the husbands for my three girls.
            Husbands are a matter of taste, I guess, and a girl ought to know
            what sort she wants. If she don't, and makes a mistake, that's <i>her</i>
            look-out. So you can all choose for yourselves, when the time comes,
            and I'll stand by you, my dears, through thick and thin. If the
            husband won't play fair, you can always bet your Uncle John will.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, we know, that,&quot; said Patsy, simply; and Beth added:
            &quot;Of course, Uncle, dear.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Thursday evening, the third and last of the series, was after all
            the banner night of the great Kermess. All the world of society was
            present and such wares as remained unsold in the booths were quickly
            auctioned off by several fashionable gentlemen with a talent for
            such brigandage. Then, the national dances and songs having been
            given and received enthusiastically, a grand ball wound up the
            occasion in the merriest possible way.
          </p>
          <p>
            Charlie Mershone was much in evidence this evening, as he had been
            before; but he took no active part in the proceedings and refrained
            from dancing, his pet amusement. Diana observed that he made
            frequent trips downstairs, perhaps to the hotel offices. No one paid
            any attention to his movements, except his cousin, and Miss Von
            Taer, watching him intently, decided that underneath his calm
            exterior lurked a great deal of suppressed excitement.
          </p>
          <p>
            At last the crowd began to disperse. Uncle John and the Major took
            Beth and Patsy away early, as soon as their booth was closed; but
            Louise stayed for a final waltz or two with Arthur. She soon found,
            however, that the evening's work and excitement had tired her, and
            asked to be taken home.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'll go and get the limousine around,&quot; said Arthur.
            &quot;That new chauffeur is a stupid fellow. By the time you've
            managed in this jam to get your wraps I shall be ready. Come down in
            the elevator and I'll meet you at the Thirty-second street entrance.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            As he reached the street a man&mdash;an ordinary servant, to judge
            from his appearance&mdash;ran into him full tilt, and when they
            recoiled from the impact the fellow with a muttered curse raised his
            fist and struck young Weldon a powerful blow. Reeling backward, a
            natural anger seized Arthur, who was inclined to be hot-headed, and
            he also struck out with his fists, never pausing to consider that
            the more dignified act would be to call the police.
          </p>
          <p>
            The little spurt of fistcuffs was brief, but it gave Mershone, who
            stood in the shadow of the door-way near by, time to whisper to a
            police officer, who promptly seized the disputants and held them
            both in a firm grip.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What's all this?&quot; he demanded, sternly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That drunken loafer assaulted me without cause&quot; gasped
            Arthur, panting.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It's a lie!&quot; retorted the man, calmly; &quot;he struck me
            first.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Well, I arrest you both,&quot; said the officer.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Arrest!&quot; cried Arthur, indignantly; &quot;why, confound
            it, man, I'm&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;No talk!&quot; was the stern command. &quot;Come along and
            keep quiet.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            As if the whole affair had been premeditated and prearranged a
            patrol wagon at that instant backed to the curb and in spite of
            Arthur Weldon's loud protests he was thrust inside with his
            assailant and at once driven away at a rapid gait.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the same moment a brown limousine drew up quietly before the
            entrance.
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise, appearing in the doorway in her opera cloak, stood
            hesitating on the steps, peering into the street for Arthur. A man
            in livery approached her.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;This way, please, Miss Merrick,&quot; he said. &quot;Mr.
            Weldon begs you to be seated in the limousine. He will join you in a
            moment.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            With this he led the way to the car and held the door open, while
            the girl, having no suspicion, entered and sank back wearily upon
            the seat. Then the door abruptly slammed, and the man in livery
            leaped to the seat beside the chauffeur and with a jerk the car
            darted away.
          </p>
          <p>
            So sudden and astounding was this <i>denouement</i> that Louise did
            not even scream. Indeed, for the moment her wits were dazed.
          </p>
          <p>
            And now Charlie Mershone stepped from his hiding place and with a
            satirical smile entered the vestibule and looked at his watch. He
            found he had time to show himself again at the Kermess, for a few
            moments, before driving to the ferry to catch the train for East
            Orange.
          </p>
          <p>
            Some one touched him on the arm.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Very pretty, sir, and quite cleverly done,&quot; remarked a
            quiet voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone started and glared at the speaker, a slender, unassuming
            man in dark clothes.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What do you mean, fellow?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I've been watching the comedy, sir, and I saw you were the
            star actor, although you took care to keep hidden in the wings. That
            bruiser who raised the row took his arrest very easily; I suppose
            you've arranged to pay his fine, and he isn't worried. But the
            gentleman surely was in hard luck pounded one minute and pinched the
            next. You arranged it very cleverly, indeed.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Charlie was relieved that no mention was made of the abduction of
            Louise. Had that incident escaped notice? He gave the man another
            sharp look and turned away; but the gentle touch again restrained
            him.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Not yet, please, Mr. Mershone.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Who are you?&quot; asked the other, scowling.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;The house detective. It's my business to watch things. So I
            noticed you talking to the police officer; I also noticed the patrol
            wagon standing on the opposite side of the street for nearly an hour&mdash;my
            report on that will amuse them at headquarters, won't it? And I
            noticed you nod to the bruiser, just as your victim came out.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Let go of my arm, sir!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Do you prefer handcuffs? I arrest you. We'll run over to the
            station and explain things.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Do you know who I am?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Perfectly, Mr. Mershone. I believe I ran you in for less than
            this, some two years ago. You gave the name of Ryder, then. Better
            take another, to-night.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;If you're the house detective, why do you mix up in this
            affair?&quot; enquired Mershone, his anxiety showing in his tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Your victim was a guest of the house.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Not at all. He was merely attending the Kermess.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That makes him our guest, sir. Are you ready?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone glanced around and then lowered his voice.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It's all a little joke, my dear fellow,&quot; said he, &quot;and
            you are liable to spoil everything with your bungling. Here,&quot;
            drawing; a roll of bills from his pocket, &quot;don't let us waste
            any more time. I'm busy.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The man chuckled and waved aside the bribe.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You certainly are, sir; you're <i>very</i> busy, just now! But
            I think the sergeant over at the station will give you some leisure.
            And listen, Mr. Mershone: I've got it in for that policeman you
            fixed; he's a cheeky individual and a new man. I'm inclined to think
            this night's work will cost him his position. And the patrol, which
            I never can get when I want it, seems under your direct management.
            These things have got to be explained, and I need your help. Ready,
            sir?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone looked grave, but he was not wholly checkmated. Thank
            heaven the bungling detective had missed the departure of Louise
            altogether. Charlie's arrest at this critical juncture was most
            unfortunate, but need not prove disastrous to his cleverly-laid
            plot. He decided it would be best to go quietly with the &quot;plain-clothes
            man.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Weldon had become nearly frantic in his demands to be released when
            Mershone was ushered into the station. He started at seeing his
            enemy and began to fear a thousand terrible, indefinite things,
            knowing how unscrupulous Mershone was. But the Waldorf detective,
            who seemed friendly with the police sergeant, made a clear, brief
            statement of the facts he had observed. Mershone denied the
            accusation; the bruiser denied it; the policeman and the driver of
            the patrol wagon likewise stolidly denied it. Indeed, they had quite
            another story to tell.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the sergeant acted on his own judgment. He locked up Mershone,
            refusing bail. He suspended the policeman and the driver, pending
            investigation. Then he released Arthur Weldon on his own
            recognisance, the young man promising to call and testify when
            required.
          </p>
          <p>
            The house detective and Arthur started back to the Waldorf together.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Did you notice a young lady come to the entrance, soon after I
            was driven away?&quot; he asked, anxiously.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;A lady in a rose-colored opera cloak, sir?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes! yes!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why, she got into a brown limousine and rode away.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthur gave a sigh of relief.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Thank goodness that chauffeur had a grain of sense,&quot; said
            he. &quot;I wouldn't have given him credit for it. Anyway, I'm glad
            Miss Merrick is safe.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Huh!&quot; grunted the detective, stopping short. &quot;I
            begin to see this thing in its true light. How stupid we've been!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;In what way?&quot; enquired Arthur, uneasily.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why did Mershone get you arrested, just at that moment?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Because he hated me, I suppose.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Tell me, could he have any object in spiriting away that young
            lady&mdash;in abducting her?&quot; asked the detective.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Could he?&quot; cried Arthur, terrified and trembling. &quot;He
            had every object known to villainy. Come to the hotel! Let's hurry,
            man&mdash;let's fly!&quot;
          </p>

            CHAPTER XII
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            FOGERTY
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            At the Waldorf Arthur's own limousine was standing by the curb. The
            street was nearly deserted. The last of the Kermess people had gone
            home.
          </p>
          <p>
            Weldon ran to his chauffeur.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Did you take Miss Merrick home?&quot; he eagerly enquired.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Miss Merrick? Why, I haven't seen her, sir, I thought you'd
            all forgotten me.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The young man's heart sank. Despair seized him. The detective was
            carefully examining the car.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;They're pretty nearly mates, Mr. Weldon. as far as the brown
            color and general appearances go,&quot; he said. &quot;But I'm
            almost positive the car that carried the young lady away was of
            another make.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What make was it?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The man shook his head.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Can't say, sir. I was mighty stupid, and that's a fact. But my
            mind was so full of that assault and battery case, and the trickery
            of that fellow Mershone, that I wasn't looking for anything else.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Can you get away?&quot; asked Arthur. &quot;Can you help me on
            this case?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;No, sir; I must remain on duty at the hotel. But perhaps the
            young lady is now safe at home, and we've been borrowing trouble. In
            case she's been stolen, however, you'd better see Fogerty.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Who's Fogerty?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Here's his card, sir. He's a private detective, and may be
            busy just now, for all I know. But if you can get Fogerty you've got
            the best man in all New York.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthur sprang into the seat beside his driver and hurried post-haste
            to the Merrick residence. In a few minutes Mrs. Merrick was in
            violent hysterics at the disappearance of her daughter. Arthur
            stopped long enough to telephone for a doctor and then drove to the
            Doyles. He routed up Uncle John and the Major, who appeared in
            pajamas and bath-robes, and told them the startling news.
          </p>
          <p>
            A council of war was straightway held. Uncle John trembled with
            nervousness; Arthur was mentally stupefied; the Major alone was
            calm.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;In the first place,&quot; said he, &quot;what object could the
            man have in carrying off Louise?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthur hesitated.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;To prevent our marriage, I suppose,&quot; he answered. &quot;Mershone
            has an idea he loves Louise. He made wild love to her until she cut
            his acquaintance.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But it won't help him any to separate her from her friends, or
            her promised husband,&quot; declared the Major. &quot;Don't worry.
            We're sure to find her, sooner or later.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;How? How shall we find her?&quot; cried Uncle John. &quot;Will
            he murder her, or what?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why, as for that, John, he's safe locked up in jail for the
            present, and unable to murder anyone,&quot; retorted the Major.
            &quot;It's probable he meant to follow Louise, and induce her by
            fair means or foul to marry him. But he's harmless enough for the
            time being.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It's not for long, though,&quot; said Arthur, fearfully.
            &quot;They're liable to let him out in the morning, for he has
            powerful friends, scoundrel though he is. And when he is free&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Then he must be shadowed, of course,&quot; returned the Major,
            nodding wisely. &quot;If it's true the fellow loves Louise, then
            he's no intention of hurting her. So make your minds easy. Wherever
            the poor lass has been taken to, she's probably safe enough.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But think of her terror&mdash;her suffering!&quot; cried Uncle
            John, wringing his chubby hands. &quot;Poor child! It may be his
            idea to compromise her, and break her heart!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;We'll stop all that, John, never fear,&quot; promised the
            Major. &quot;The first thing to do is to find a good detective.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Fogerty!&quot; exclaimed Arthur, searching for the card.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Who's Fogerty?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I don't know.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Get the best man possible!&quot; commanded Mr. Merrick. &quot;Spare
            no expense; hire a regiment of detectives, if necessary; I'll&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Of course you will,&quot; interrupted the Major, smiling.
            &quot;But we won't need a regiment. I'm pretty sure the game is in
            our hands, from the very start.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Fogerty is highly recommended,&quot; explained Arthur, and
            related what the house detective of the Waldorf had said.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Better go at once and hunt him up,&quot; suggested Uncle John.
            &quot;What time is it?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;After two o'clock. But I'll go at once.&quot; &quot;Do; and
            let us hear from you whenever you've anything to tell us,&quot; said
            the Major.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Where's Patsy?&quot; asked Arthur.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Sound asleep. Mind ye, not a word of this to Patsy till she <i>has</i>
            to be told. Remember that, John.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Well, I'll go,&quot; said the young man, and hurried away.
          </p>
          <p>
            Q. Fogerty lived on Eleventh street, according to his card. Arthur
            drove down town, making good time. The chauffeur asked surlily if
            this was to be &quot;an all-night job,&quot; and Arthur savagely
            replied that it might take a week. &quot;Can't you see, Jones, that
            I'm in great trouble?&quot; he added. &quot;But you shall be well
            paid for your extra time.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;All right, sir. That's no more than just,&quot; said the man.
            &quot;It's none of my affair, you know, if a young lady gets stolen.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthur was wise enough to restrain his temper and the temptation to
            kick Jones out of the limousine. Five minutes later they paused
            before a block of ancient brick dwellings and found Fogerty's
            number. A card over the bell bore his name, and Arthur lit a match
            and read it. Then he rang impatiently.
          </p>
          <p>
            Only silence.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthur rang a second time; waited, and rang again. A panic of fear
            took possession of him. At this hour of night it would be well-nigh
            impossible to hunt up another detective if Fogerty failed him. He
            determined to persist as long as there was hope. Again he rang.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Look above, sir,&quot; called Jones from his station in the
            car.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthur stepped back on the stone landing and looked up. A round
            spark, as from a cigarette, was visible at the open window. While he
            gazed the spark glowered brighter and illumined a pale, haggard
            boy's face, surmounted by tousled locks of brick colored hair.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Hi, there!&quot; said Arthur. &quot;Does Mr. Fogerty live
            here?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;He pays the rent,&quot; answered a boyish voice, with a tinge
            of irony. &quot;What's wanted?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Mr. Fogerty is wanted. Is he at home?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;He is,&quot; responded the boy.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I must see him at once&mdash;on important business. Wake him
            up, my lad; will you?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Wait a minute,&quot; said the youth, and left the window.
            Presently he opened the front door, slipped gently out and closed
            the door behind him.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Let's sit in your car,&quot; he said, in soft, quiet tones.
            &quot;We can talk more freely there.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But I must see Fogerty at once!&quot; protested Arthur.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm Fogerty.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Q. Fogerty?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Quintus Fogerty&mdash;the first and last and only individual
            of that name.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthur hesitated; he was terribly disappointed.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Are you a detective?&quot; he enquired.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;By profession.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But you can't be very old.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The boy laughed.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm no antiquity, sir,&quot; said he, &quot;but I've shed the
            knickerbockers long ago. Who sent you to me?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why do you ask?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm tired. I've been busy twenty-three weeks. Just finished my
            case yesterday and need a rest&mdash;a good long rest. But if you
            want a man I'll refer you to a friend.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Gorman, of the Waldorf, sent me to you&mdash;and said you'd
            help me.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh; that's different. Case urgent, sir?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Very. The young lady I'm engaged to marry was abducted less
            than three hours ago.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Fogerty lighted another cigarette and the match showed Arthur that
            the young face was deeply lined, while two cold gray eyes stared
            blankly into his own.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Let's sit in your limousine, sir,&quot; he repeated.
          </p>
          <p>
            When they had taken their places behind the closed doors the boy
            asked Arthur to tell him &quot;all about it, and don't forget any
            details, please.&quot; So Weldon hastily told the events of the
            evening and gave a history of Mershone and his relations with Miss
            Merrick. The story was not half told when Fogerty said:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Tell your man to drive to the police station.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            On the way Arthur resumed his rapid recital and strove to post the
            young detective as well as he was able. Fogerty made no remarks, nor
            did he ask a single question until Weldon had told him everything he
            could think of. Then he made a few pointed enquiries and presently
            they had arrived at the station.
          </p>
          <p>
            The desk sergeant bowed with great respect to the youthful
            detective. By the dim light Arthur was now able to examine Fogerty
            for the first time.
          </p>
          <p>
            He was small, slim and lean. His face attested to but eighteen or
            nineteen years, in spite of its deep lines and serious expression.
            Although his hair was tangled and unkempt Fogerty's clothing and
            linen were neat and of good quality. He wore a Scotch cap and a
            horseshoe pin in his cravat.
          </p>
          <p>
            One might have imagined him to be an errand boy, a clerk, a
            chauffeur, a salesman or a house man. You might have placed him in
            almost any middle-class walk in life. Perhaps, thought Arthur, he
            might even be a good detective! yet his personality scarcely
            indicated it.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Mershone in, Billy?&quot; the detective asked the desk
            sergeant.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Room 24. Want him?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Not now. When is he likely to go?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;When Parker relieves me. There's been a reg'lar mob here to
            get Mershone off. I couldn't prevent his using the telephone; but
            I'm a stubborn duck; eh, Quintus? And now the gentleman has gone to
            bed, vowing vengeance.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You're all right, Billy. We both know Mershone. Gentleman
            scoundrel.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Exactly. Swell society blackleg.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What name's he docked under?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Smith.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Will Parker let him off with a fine?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes, or without it. Parker comes on at six.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Good. I'll take a nap on that bench. Got to keep the fellow in
            sight, Billy.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Go into my room. There's a cot there.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Thanks, old man; I will. I'm dead tired.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Then Fogerty took Arthur aside.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Go home and try to sleep,&quot; he advised. &quot;Don't worry.
            The young lady's safe enough till Mershone goes to her hiding place.
            When he does, I'll be there, too, and I'll try to have you with me.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Do you think you can arrange it alone, Mr. Fogerty?&quot;
            asked Arthur, doubtfully. The boy seemed so very young.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Better than if I had a hundred to assist me. Why, this is an
            easy job, Mr. Weldon. It 'll give me a fine chance to rest up.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And you won't lose Mershone?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Never. He's mine.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;This is very important to me, sir,&quot; continued Arthur,
            nervously.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes; and to others. Most of all it's important to Fogerty.
            Don't worry, sir.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The young man was forced to go away with this assurance. He returned
            home, but not to sleep. He wondered vaguely if he had been wise to
            lean upon so frail a reed as Fogerty seemed to be; and above all he
            wondered where poor Louise was, and if terror and alarm were
            breaking her heart.

          <h2>
            CHAPTER XIII
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            DIANA REVOLTS
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            Charlie Mershone had no difficulty in securing his release when
            Parker came on duty at six o'clock. He called up a cab and went at
            once to his rooms at the Bruxtelle; and Fogerty followed him.
          </p>
          <p>
            While he discarded his dress-coat, took a bath and donned his
            walking suit Mershone was in a brown study. Hours ago Louise had
            been safely landed at the East Orange house and placed in the care
            of old Madame Cerise, who would guard her like an ogre. There was no
            immediate need of his hastening after her, and his arrest and the
            discovery of half his plot had seriously disturbed him. This young
            man was no novice in intrigue, nor even in crime. Arguing from his
            own stand-point he realized that the friends of Louise were by this
            time using every endeavor to locate her. They would not succeed in
            this, he was positive. His plot had been so audacious and all clews
            so cleverly destroyed or covered up that the most skillful
            detective, knowing he had abducted the girl; would be completely
            baffled in an attempt to find her.
          </p>
          <p>
            The thought of detectives, in this connection, led him to decide
            that he was likely to be shadowed. That was the most natural thing
            for his opponents to do. They could not prove Mershone's complicity
            in the disappearance of Louise Merrick, but they might easily
            suspect him, after that little affair of Weldon's arrest. Therefore
            if he went to the girl now he was likely to lead others to her.
            Better be cautious and wait until he had thrown the sleuths off his
            track.
          </p>
          <p>
            Having considered this matter thoroughly, Mershone decided to remain
            quiet. By eight o'clock he was breakfasting in the grill room, and
            Fogerty occupied a table just behind him.
          </p>
          <p>
            During the meal it occurred to Charlie to telephone to Madame Cerise
            for assurance that Louise had arrived safely and without a scene to
            attract the attention of strangers. Having finished breakfast he
            walked into the telephone booth and was about to call his number
            when a thought struck him. He glanced out of the glass door. In the
            hotel lobby were many loungers. He saw a dozen pairs of eyes fixed
            upon him idly or curiously; one pair might belong to the suspected
            detective. If he used the telephone there would be a way of
            discovering the number he had asked for. That would not do&mdash;not
            at all! He concluded not to telephone, at present, and left the
            booth.
          </p>
          <p>
            His next act was to purchase a morning paper, and seating himself
            carelessly in a chair he controlled the impulse to search for a
            &quot;scare head&quot; on the abduction of Miss Merrick. If he came
            across the item, very well; he would satisfy no critical eye that
            might be scanning him by hunting for it with a show of eagerness.
            The game was in his hands, he believed, and he intended to keep it
            there.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fogerty was annoyed by the man's evident caution. It would not be
            easy to surprise Mershone in any self-incriminating action. But,
            after all, reflected the boy, resting comfortably in the soft-padded
            cushions of a big leather chair, all this really made the case the
            more interesting. He was rather glad Mershone was in no hurry to
            precipitate a climax. A long stern chase was never a bad chase.
          </p>
          <p>
            By and bye another idea occurred to Charlie. He would call upon his
            cousin Diana, and get her to telephone Madame Cerise for information
            about Louise. It would do no harm to enlighten Diana as to what he
            had done. She must suspect it already; and was she not a
            co-conspirator?
          </p>
          <p>
            But he could not wisely make this call until the afternoon. So
            meantime he took a stroll into Broadway and walked leisurely up and
            down that thoroughfare, pausing occasionally to make a trifling
            purchase and turning abruptly again and again in the attempt to
            discover who might be following him. No one liable to be a detective
            of any sort could he discern; yet he was too shrewd to be lulled
            into a false belief that his each and every act was unobserved.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone returned to his hotel, went to his room, and slept until
            after one o'clock, as he had secured but little rest the night
            before in his primitive quarters at the police station. It was
            nearly two when he reappeared in the hotel restaurant for luncheon,
            and he took his seat and ate with excellent appetite.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this meal Mr. Fogerty also took occasion to refresh himself,
            eating modestly at a retired table in a corner. Mershone's sharp
            eyes noted him. He remembered seeing this youth at breakfast, and
            thoughtfully reflected that the boy's appearance was not such as
            might be expected from the guest of a fashionable and high-priced
            hotel. Silently he marked this individual as the possible detective.
            He had two or three others in his mind, by this time; the boy was
            merely added to the list of possibilities.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone was a capital actor. After luncheon he sauntered about the
            hotel, stared from the window for a time, looked at his watch once
            or twice with an undecided air, and finally stepped to the porter
            and asked him to call a cab. He started for Central Park; then
            changed his mind and ordered the man to drive him to the Von Taer
            residence, where on arrival Diana at once ordered him shown into her
            private parlor.
          </p>
          <p>
            The young man found his cousin stalking up and down in an extremely
            nervous manner. She wrung her delicate fingers with a swift,
            spasmodic motion. Her eyes, nearly closed, shot red rays through
            their slits.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What's wrong, Di?&quot; demanded Mershone, considerably
            surprised by this intense display of emotion on the part of his
            usually self-suppressed and collected cousin.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Wrong!&quot; she echoed; &quot;everything is wrong. You've
            ruined yourself, Charlie; and you're going to draw me into this
            dreadful crime, also, in spite of all I can do!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Bah! don't be a fool,&quot; he observed, calmly taking a
            chair.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Am <i>I</i> the fool?&quot; she exclaimed, turning upon him
            fiercely. &quot;Did <i>I</i> calmly perpetrate a deed that was sure
            to result in disgrace and defeat?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What on earth has happened to upset you?&quot; he asked,
            wonderingly. &quot;It strikes me everything is progressing
            beautifully.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Does it, indeed?&quot; was her sarcastic rejoinder. &quot;Then
            your information is better than mine. They called me up at three
            o'clock this morning to enquire after Louise Merrick&mdash;as if <i>I</i>
            should know her whereabouts. Why did they come to <i>me</i> for such
            information? Why?&quot; she stamped her foot for emphasis.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I suppose,&quot; said Charlie Mershone, &quot;they called up
            everyone who knows the girl. It would be natural in case of her
            disappearance.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Come here!&quot; cried Diana, seizing his arm and dragging him
            to a window. &quot;Be careful; try to look out without showing
            yourself. Do you see that man on the corner?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Well?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;He has been patrolling this house since day-break. He's a
            detective!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Charlie whistled.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What makes you think so, Di? Why on earth should they suspect
            you?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why? Because my disreputable cousin planned the abduction,
            without consulting me, and&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, come, Di; that's a little too&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Because the girl has been carried to the Von Taer house&mdash;<i>my</i>
            house&mdash;in East Orange; because my own servant is at this moment
            her jailor, and&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;How should they know all this?&quot; interrupted Mershone,
            impatiently. &quot;And how do you happen to know it yourself, Diana?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Madame Cerise called me up at five o'clock, just after
            Louise's uncle had been here for the second time, with a crew of
            officers. Cerise is in an ugly mood. She said a young girl had been
            brought to her a prisoner, and Mr. Mershone's orders were to keep
            her safely until he came. She is greatly provoked at our using her
            in this way, but promised to follow instructions if I accepted all
            responsibility.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What did you tell her?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That I knew nothing of the affair, but had put the house and
            her services at your disposal. I said I would accept no
            responsibility whatever for anything you might do.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone looked grave, and scowled.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;The old hag won't betray us, will she?&quot; he asked,
            uneasily.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;She cannot betray me, for I have done nothing. Charlie,&quot;
            she said, suddenly facing him, &quot;I won't be mixed in this horrid
            affair. You must carry out your infamous plan in your own way. I
            know nothing, sir, of what you have done; I know nothing of what you
            intend to do. Do you understand me?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            He smiled rather grimly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I hardly expected, my fair cousin, that you would be
            frightened into retreat at this stage of the game, when the cards
            are all in our hands. Do you suppose I decided to carry away Louise
            without fully considering what I was doing, and the immediate
            consequences of my act? And wherein have I failed? All has gone
            beautifully up to this minute. Diana, your fears are absolutely
            foolish, and against your personal interests. All that I am doing
            for myself benefits you doubly. Just consider, if you will, what has
            been accomplished for our mutual benefit: The girl has disappeared
            under suspicious circumstances; before she again rejoins her family
            and friends she will either be my wife or Arthur Weldon will prefer
            not to marry her. That leaves him open to appreciate the charms of
            Diana Von Taer, does it not? Already, my dear cousin, your wishes
            are accomplished. My own task, I admit, is a harder one, because it
            is more delicate.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The cold-blooded brutality of this argument caused even Diana to
            shudder. She looked at the young man half fearfully as she asked:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What is your task?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why, first to quiet Louise's fears; then to turn her by
            specious arguments&mdash;lies, if you will &mdash;against Weldon;
            next to induce her to give me her hand in honest wedlock. I shall
            tell her of my love, which is sincere; I shall argue&mdash;threaten,
            if necessary; use every reasonable means to gain her consent.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You'll never succeed!&quot; cried Diana, with conviction.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Then I'll try other tactics,&quot; said he blandly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;If you do, you monster, I'll expose you,&quot; warned the
            girl.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Having dissolved partnership, you won't be taken into my
            confidence, my fair cousin. You have promised to know nothing of my
            acts, and I'll see you don't.&quot; Then he sprang from his chair
            and came to her with a hard, determined look upon his face. &quot;Look
            here, Di; I've gone too far in this game to back out now, I'm going
            to carry it through if it costs me my life and liberty&mdash;and
            yours into the bargain! I love Louise Merrick! I love her so well
            that without her the world and its mockeries can go to the devil!
            There's nothing worth living for but Louise&mdash;Louise. She's
            going to be my wife, Diana&mdash;by fair means or foul I swear to
            make her my wife.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            He had worked himself up to a pitch of excitement surpassing that of
            Diana. Now he passed his hand over his forehead, collected himself
            with a slight shudder, and resumed his seat.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana was astonished. His fierce mood served to subdue her own.
            Regarding him curiously for a time she finally asked:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You speak as if you were to be allowed to have your own way&mdash;as
            if all society was not arrayed against you. Have you counted the
            cost of your action? Have you considered the consequences of this
            crime?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I have committed no crime,&quot; he said stubbornly. &quot;All's
            fair in love and war.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;The courts will refuse to consider that argument, I imagine,&quot;
            she retorted. &quot;Moreover, the friends of this kidnaped girl are
            powerful and active. They will show you no mercy if you are
            discovered.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;If I fail,&quot; answered Mershone, slowly, &quot;I do not
            care a continental what they do to me, for my life will be a blank
            without Louise. But I really see no reason to despair, despite your
            womanish croakings. All seems to be going nicely and just as I had
            anticipated.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I am glad that you are satisfied,&quot; Diana returned, with
            scornful emphasis. &quot;But understand me, sir; this is none of my
            affair in any way&mdash; except that I shall surely expose you if a
            hair of the girl's head is injured. You must not come here again. I
            shall refuse to see you. You ought not to have come to-day.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Is there anything suspicious in my calling upon my cousin&mdash;as
            usual?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Under such circumstances, yes. You have not been received at
            this house of late years, and my father still despises you. There is
            another danger you have brought upon me. My father seemed suspicious
            this morning, and asked me quite pointedly what I knew of this
            strange affair.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But of course you lied to him. All right, Diana; perhaps there
            is nothing to be gained from your alliance, and I'll let you out of
            the deal from this moment. The battle's mine, after all, and I'll
            fight it alone. But&mdash;I need more money. You ought to be willing
            to pay, for so far the developments are all in your favor.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            She brought a handful of notes from her desk.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;This ends our partnership, Charlie,&quot; she said.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Very well. A woman makes a poor conspirator, but is invaluable
            as a banker.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;There will be no more money. This ends everything between us.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I thought you were game, Di. But you're as weak as the
            ordinary feminine creation.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            She did not answer, but stood motionless, a defiant expression upon
            her face. He laughed a little, bowed mockingly, and went away.

            CHAPTER XIV
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            A COOL ENCOUNTER
          </p>
          <p>
            On leaving the house Mershone buttoned his overcoat tightly up to
            his chin, for the weather was cold and raw, and then shot a quick
            glance around him. Diana's suspect was still lounging on the corner.
            Charlie had little doubt he was watching the house and the movements
            of its in-mates &mdash;a bad sign, he reflected, with a frown.
            Otherwise the street seemed deserted.
          </p>
          <p>
            He had dismissed the cab on his arrival, so now he stepped out and
            walked briskly around the corner, swinging his cane jauntily and
            looking very unlike a fugitive. In the next block he passed a youth
            who stood earnestly examining the conventional display in a
            druggist's window.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone, observing this individual, gave a start, but did not alter
            his pace. It was the same pale, red-haired boy he had noticed twice
            before at the hotel. In his alert, calculating mind there was no
            coincidence in this meeting. Before he had taken six more steps
            Mershone realized the exact situation.
          </p>
          <p>
            At the next crossing he stopped and waited patiently for a car. Up
            the street he still saw the youth profoundly interested in drugs&mdash;a
            class of merchandise that seldom calls for such close inspection.
            The car arrived and carried Mershone away. It also left the
            red-haired youth at his post before the window. Yet on arriving at
            the Bruxtelle some twenty minutes later Charlie found this same
            queer personage occupying a hotel chair in the lobby and apparently
            reading a newspaper with serious attention.
          </p>
          <p>
            He hesitated a moment, then quietly walked over to a vacant chair
            beside the red-haired one and sat down. The youth turned the paper,
            glanced casually at his neighbor, and continued reading.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;A detective, I believe,&quot; said Mershone, in a low, matter
            of fact tone.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Who? me?&quot; asked Fogerty, lowering the paper.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes. Your age deceived me for a time. I imagined you were a
            newsboy or a sporting kid from the country; but now I observe you
            are older than you appear. All sorts of people seem to drift into
            the detective business. I suppose your present occupation is
            shadowing me.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Fogerty smiled. The smile was genuine.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I might even be a lawyer, sir,&quot; he replied, &quot;and in
            that case I should undertake to cross-examine you, and ask your
            reasons for so queer a charge.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Or you might be a transient guest at this hotel,&quot; the
            other returned, in the same bantering tone, &quot;for I saw you at
            breakfast and luncheon. Pretty fair <i>chef</i> here, isn't he? But
            you didn't stick to that part, you know. You followed me up-town,
            where I made a call on a relative, and you studied the colored
            globes in a druggist's window when I went away. I wonder why people
            employ inexperienced boys in such important matters. In your case,
            my lad, it was easy enough to detect the detective. You even took
            the foolish chance of heading me off, and returned to this hotel
            before I did. Now, then, is my charge unfounded?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why should you be under the surveillance of a detective?&quot;
            asked Fogerty, slowly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Really, my boy, I cannot say. There was an unpleasant little
            affair last night at the Waldorf, in which I was not personally
            concerned, but suffered, nevertheless. An officious deputy caused my
            arrest and I spent an unpleasant night in jail. There being nothing
            in the way of evidence against me I was released this morning, and
            now I find a detective shadowing me. What can it all mean, I wonder?
            These stupid blunders are very annoying to the plain citizen, who,
            however innocent, feels himself the victim of a conspiracy.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I understand you, sir,&quot; said Fogerty, drily.
          </p>
          <p>
            For some moments Mershone now remained silent. Then he asked; &quot;What
            are your instructions concerning me?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            To his surprise the boy made a simple, frank admission.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm to see you don't get into more mischief, sir.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And how long is this nonsense to continue?&quot; demanded
            Mershone, showing a touch of anger for the first time.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Depends on yourself, Mr. Mershone; I'm no judge, myself. I'm
            so young&mdash;and inexperienced.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Who is your employer?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, I'm just sent out by an agency.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Is it a big paying proposition?&quot; asked Charlie, eyeing
            the diffident youth beside him critically, as if to judge his true
            caliber.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Not very big. You see, if I'd been a better detective you'd
            never have spotted me so quickly.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I suppose money counts with you, though, as it does with
            everyone else in the world?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Of course, sir. Every business is undertaken to make money.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone drew his chair a little nearer.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I need a clever detective myself,&quot; he announced,
            confidentially. &quot;I'm anxious to discover what enemy is
            persecuting me in this way. Would it&mdash;er&mdash;be impossible
            for me to employ <i>you</i> to&mdash;er&mdash;look after my
            interests?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Fogerty was very serious.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You see, sir,&quot; he responded, &quot;if I quit this job
            they may not give me another. In order to be a successful detective
            one must keep in the good graces of the agencies.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That's easy enough,&quot; asserted Mershone. &quot;You may
            pretend to keep this job, but go home and take life easy. I'll send
            you a daily statement of what I've been doing, and you can fix up a
            report to your superior from that. In addition to this you can put
            in a few hours each day trying to find out who is annoying me in
            this rascally manner, and for this service I'll pay you five times
            the agency price. How does that proposition strike you, Mr.&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Riordan. Me name's Riordan,&quot; said Fogerty, with a smile.
            &quot;No, Mr. Mershone,&quot; shaking his head gravely, &quot;I
            can't see my way to favor you. It's an easy job now, and I'm afraid
            to take chances with a harder one.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Something in the tone nettled Mershone.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But the pay,&quot; he suggested.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, the pay. If I'm a detective fifty years, I'll make an easy
            two thousand a year. That's a round hundred thousand. Can you pay me
            that much to risk my future career as a detective?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone bit his lip. This fellow was not so simple, after all,
            boyish as he seemed. And, worse than all, he had a suspicion the
            youngster was baiting him, and secretly laughing at his offers of
            bribery.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;They will take you off the job, now that I have discovered
            your identity,&quot; he asserted, with malicious satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, no,&quot; answered Fogerty; &quot;they won't do that. This
            little interview merely simplifies matters. You see, sir, I'm an
            expert at disguises. That's my one great talent, as many will
            testify. But you will notice that in undertaking this job I resorted
            to no disguise at all. You see me as nature made me&mdash;and 't was
            a poor job, I'm thinking.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why were you so careless?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It wasn't carelessness; it was premeditated. There's not the
            slightest objection to your knowing me. My only business is to keep
            you in sight, and I can do that exactly as well as Riordan as I
            could by disguising myself.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone had it on his tongue's end to ask what they expected to
            discover by shadowing him, but decided it was as well not to open an
            avenue for the discussion of Miss Merrick's disappearance. So,
            finding he could not bribe the youthful detective or use him in any
            way to his advantage, he closed the interview by rising.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm going to my room to write some letters,&quot; said he,
            with a yawn. &quot;Would you like to read them before they are
            mailed?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Again Fogerty laughed in his cheerful, boyish way.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You'd make a fine detective yourself, Mr. Mershone,&quot; he
            declared, &quot;and I advise you to consider the occupation. I've a
            notion it's safer, and better pay, than your present line.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Charlie scowled at the insinuation, but walked away without reply.
            Fogerty eyed his retreating figure a moment, gave a slight shrug and
            resumed his newspaper.
          </p>
          <p>
            Day followed day without further event, and gradually Mershone came
            to feel himself trapped. Wherever he might go he found Fogerty on
            duty, unobtrusive, silent and watchful. It was very evident that he
            was waiting for the young man to lead him to the secret hiding place
            of Louise Merrick.
          </p>
          <p>
            In one way this constant surveillance was a distinct comfort to
            Charlie Mershone, for it assured him that the retreat of Louise was
            still undiscovered. But he must find some way to get rid of his
            &quot;shadow,&quot; in order that he might proceed to carry out his
            plans concerning the girl. During his enforced leisure he invented a
            dozen apparently clever schemes, only to abandon them again as
            unpractical.
          </p>
          <p>
            One afternoon, while on a stroll, he chanced to meet the bruiser who
            had attacked Arthur Weldon at the Waldorf, and been liberally paid
            by Mershone for his excellent work. He stopped the man, and glancing
            hastily around found that Fogerty was a block in the rear.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Listen,&quot; he said; &quot;I want your assistance, and if
            you're quick and sure there is a pot of money, waiting for you.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I need it, Mr. Mershone,&quot; replied the man, grinning.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;There's a detective following me; he's down the street there&mdash;a
            mere boy--just in front of that tobacco store. See him?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Sure I see him. It's Fogerty.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;His name is Riordan.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;No; it's Fogerty. He's no boy, sir, but the slickest 'tec' in
            the city, an' that's goin' some, I can tell you.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Well, you must get him, whoever he is. Drag him away and hold
            him for three hours&mdash;two&mdash; one. Give me a chance to slip
            him; that's all. Can you do it? I'll pay you a hundred for the job.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It's worth two hundred, Mr. Mershone. It isn't safe to fool
            with Fogerty.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'll make it two hundred.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Then rest easy,&quot; said the man. &quot;I know the guy, and
            how to handle him. You just watch him like he's watching you, Mr.
            Mershone, and if anything happens you skip as lively as a flea. I
            can use that two hundred in my business.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Then the fellow passed on, and Fogerty was still so far distant up
            the street that neither of them could see the amused smile upon his
            thin face.

            CHAPTER XV
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            A BEWILDERING EXPERIENCE
          </p>
          <p>
            When Louise Merrick entered the brown limousine, which she naturally
            supposed to belong to Arthur Weldon, she had not the faintest
            suspicion of any evil in her mind. Indeed, the girl was very happy
            this especial evening, although tired with her duties at the
            Kermess. A climax in her young life had arrived, and she greeted it
            joyously, believing she loved Arthur well enough to become his wife.
          </p>
          <p>
            Now that the engagement had been announced to their immediate circle
            of friends she felt as proud and elated as any young girl has a
            right to be under the circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Added to this pleasant event was the social triumph she and her
            cousins had enjoyed at the Kermess, where Louise especially had met
            with rare favor. The fashionable world had united in being most kind
            and considerate to the dainty, attractive young <i>debutante</i>,
            and only Diana had seemed to slight her. This was not surprising in
            view of the fact that Diana evidently wanted Arthur for herself, and
            there was some satisfaction in winning a lover who was elsewhere in
            prime demand. In addition to all this the little dance that
            concluded the evening's entertainment had been quite delightful, and
            all things conspired to put Louise in a very contented frame of
            mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            Still fluttering with the innocent excitements of the hour the girl
            went to join Arthur without a fear of impending misfortune. She did
            not think of Charlie Mershone at all. He had been annoying and
            impertinent, and she had rebuked him and sent him away, cutting him
            out of her life altogether. Perhaps she ought to have remembered
            that she had mildly flirted with Diana's cousin and given him
            opportunity for the impassioned speeches she resented; but Louise
            had a girlish idea that there was no harm in flirting, considering
            it a feminine license. She saw young Mershone at the Kermess that
            evening paying indifferent attentions to other women and ignoring
            her, and was sincerely glad to have done with him for good and all.
          </p>
          <p>
            She obeyed readily the man who asked her to be seated in the
            limousine. Arthur would be with her in a minute, he said. When the
            door closed and the car started she had an impulse to cry out but
            next moment controlled it and imagined they were to pick up Mr.
            Weldon on some corner.
          </p>
          <p>
            On and on they rolled, and still no evidence of the owner of the
            limousine. What could it mean, Louise began to wonder. Had something
            happened to Arthur, so that he had been forced to send her home
            alone? As the disquieting thought came she tried to speak with the
            chauffeur, but could not find the tube. The car was whirling along
            rapidly; the night seemed very dark, only a few lights twinkled here
            and there outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Suddenly the speed slackened. There was a momentary pause, and then
            the machine slowly rolled upon a wooden platform. A bell clanged,
            there was a whistle and the sound of revolving water-wheels. Louise
            decided they must be upon a ferry-boat, and became alarmed for the
            first time.
          </p>
          <p>
            The man in livery now opened the door, as if to reassure her.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Where are we? Where is Mr. Weldon?&quot; enquired the girl,
            almost hysterically.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;He is on the boat, miss, and will be with you shortly now,&quot;
            replied the man, very respectfully. &quot;Mr. Weldon is very sorry
            to have annoyed you, Miss Merrick, but says he will soon explain
            everything, so that you will understand why he left you.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            With this he quietly closed the door again, although Louise was
            eager to ask a dozen more questions. Prominent was the query why
            they should be on a ferry-boat instead of going directly home. She
            knew the hour must be late.
          </p>
          <p>
            But while these questions were revolving in her mind she still
            suspected no plot against her liberty. She must perforce wait for
            Arthur to explain his queer conduct; so she sat quietly enough in
            her place awaiting his coming, while the ferry puffed steadily
            across the river to the Jersey shore.
          </p>
          <p>
            The stopping of the boat aroused Louise from her reflections. Arthur
            not here yet? Voices were calling outside; vehicles were noisily
            leaving their positions on the boat to clatter across the platforms.
            But there was no sign of Arthur.
          </p>
          <p>
            Again Louise tried to find the speaking tube. Then she made an
            endeavor to open the door, although just then the car started with a
            jerk that flung her back against the cushions.
          </p>
          <p>
            The knowledge that she had been grossly deceived by her conductor at
            last had the effect of arousing the girl to a sense of her danger.
            Something must be wrong. Something <i>was</i> decidedly wrong, and
            fear crept into her heart. She pounded on the glass windows with all
            her strength, and shouted as loudly as she could, but all to no
            avail.
          </p>
          <p>
            Swiftly the limousine whirled over the dusky road and either her
            voice could not be heard through the glass cage in which she was
            confined or there was no one near who was willing to hear or to
            rescue her.
          </p>
          <p>
            She now realized how wrong she had been to sit idly during the trip
            across the ferry, where a score of passengers would gladly have
            assisted her. How cunning her captors had been to lull her fears
            during that critical period! Now, alas, it was too late to cry out,
            and she had no idea where she was being taken or the reason of her
            going.
          </p>
          <p>
            Presently it occurred to her that this was not Arthur's limousine at
            all. There was no speaking tube for one thing. She leaned forward
            and felt for the leathern pocket in which she kept a veil and her
            street gloves. No pocket of any sort was to be found.
          </p>
          <p>
            An unreasoning terror now possessed her. She knew not what to fear,
            yet feared everything. She made another attempt to cry aloud for
            help and then fell back unconscious on the cushions.
          </p>
          <p>
            How long she lay in the faint she did not know. When she recovered
            the limousine was still rattling forward at a brisk gait but bumping
            over ruts in a manner that indicated a country road.
          </p>
          <p>
            Through the curtains she could see little but the black night,
            although there was a glow ahead cast by the searchlights of the car.
            Louise was weak and unnerved. She had no energy to find a way to
            combat her fate, if such a way were possible. A dim thought of
            smashing a window and hurling herself through it gave her only a
            shudder of repulsion. She lacked strength for such a desperate
            attempt.
          </p>
          <p>
            On, on, on. Would the dreary journey never end? How long must she
            sit and suffer before she could know her fate, or at least find some
            explanation of the dreadful mystery of this wild midnight ride?
          </p>
          <p>
            At last, when she had settled down to dull despair, the car came to
            a paved road and began to move more slowly. It even stopped once or
            twice, as if the driver was not sure of his way. But they kept
            moving, nevertheless, and before long entered a driveway. There was
            another stop now, and a long wait.
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise lay dismally back upon the cushions, sobbing hysterically
            into her dripping handkerchief. The door of her prison at last
            opened and a light shone in upon her.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Here we are, miss,&quot; said the man in uniform, still in
            quiet, respectful tones. &quot;Shall I assist you to alight?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            She started up eagerly, her courage returning with a bound. Stepping
            unassisted to the ground she looked around her in bewilderment.
          </p>
          <p>
            The car stood before the entrance to a modest country house. There
            was a light in the hall and another upon the broad porch. Around the
            house a mass of trees and shrubbery loomed dark and forbidding.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Where am I?&quot; demanded Louise, drawing back haughtily as
            the man extended a hand toward her.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;At your destination, miss,&quot; was the answer. &quot;Will
            you please enter?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;No! Not until I have an explanation of this&mdash;this&mdash;singular,
            high-handed proceeding,&quot; she replied, firmly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then she glanced at the house. The hall door had opened and a woman
            stood peering anxiously at the scene outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            With sudden resolve Louise sprang up the steps and approached her.
            Any woman, she felt, in this emergency, was a welcome refuge.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Who are you?&quot; she asked eagerly, &quot;and why have I
            been brought here?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;<i>Mademoiselle</i> will come inside, please,&quot; said the
            woman, with a foreign accent. &quot;It is cold in the night air, <i>N'est-ce-pas</i>?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            She turned to lead the way inside. While Louise hesitated to follow
            the limousine started with a roar from its cylinders and disappeared
            down the driveway, the two men going with it. The absence of the
            lamps rendered the darkness around the solitary house rather
            uncanny. An intense stillness prevailed except for the diminishing
            rattle of the receding motor car. In the hall was a light and a
            woman.
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise went in.

            CHAPTER XVI
          </h2>
          <p>
            MADAME CERISE, CUSTODIAN
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The woman closed the hall door and locked it. Then she led the way
            to a long, dim drawing-room in which a grate fire was smouldering. A
            stand lamp of antique pattern but dimly illuminated the place, which
            seemed well furnished in an old fashioned way.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Will not you remove your wraps, Mees&mdash;Mees&mdash;I do not
            know ma'm'selle's name.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What is your own name?&quot; asked Louise, coming closer to
            gaze earnestly into the other's face.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I am called Madame Cerise, if it please you.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Her voice, while softened to an extent by the French accent, was
            nevertheless harsh and emotionless. She spoke as an automaton,
            slowly, and pausing to choose her words. The woman was of medium
            size, slim and straight in spite of many years. Her skin resembled
            brown parchment; her eyes were small, black and beady; her nose
            somewhat fleshy and her lips red and full as those of a young girl.
            The age of Madame Cerise might be anywhere between fifty and
            seventy; assuredly she had long been a stranger to youth, although
            her dark hair was but slightly streaked with gray. She wore a
            somber-hued gown and a maid's jaunty apron and cap.
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise inspected her closely, longing to find a friend and protector
            in this curious and strange woman. Her eyes were moist and pleading&mdash;an
            appeal hard to resist. But Madame Cerise returned her scrutiny with
            a wholly impassive expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You are a French maid?&quot; asked Louise, softly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;A housekeeper, ma'm'selle. For a time, a caretaker.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Ah, I understand. Are your employers asleep?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I cannot say, ma'm'seile. They are not here.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You are alone in this house?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Alone with you, ma'm'seile.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise had a sudden access of alarm.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And why am I here?&quot; she cried, wringing her hands
            pitifully.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Ah, who can tell that?&quot; returned the woman, composedly.
            &quot;Not Cerise, indeed. Cerise is told nothing&mdash;except what
            is required of her. I but obey my orders.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise turned quickly, at this.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What are your orders, then?&quot; she asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;To attend ma'm'selle with my best skill, to give her every
            comfort and care, to&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes&mdash;yes!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;To keep her safely until she is called for. That is all.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The girl drew a long breath.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Who will call for me, then?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I am not inform, ma'm'selle.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And I am a prisoner in this house?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Ma'm'selle may call it so, if it please her. But reflect;
            there is no place else to go. It is bleak weather, the winter soon
            comes. And here I can make you the comforts you need.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise pondered this speech, which did not deceive her. While still
            perplexed as to her abduction, with no comprehension why she should
            have been seized in such a summary manner and spirited to this
            lonely, out-of-the-way place, she realized she was in no immediate
            danger. Her weariness returned tenfold, and she staggered and caught
            the back of a chair for support.
          </p>
          <p>
            The old woman observed this.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Ma'm'selle is tired,&quot; said she. &quot;See; it is past
            four by the clock, and you must be much fatigue by the ride and the
            nervous strain.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I&mdash;I'm completely exhausted,&quot; murmured Louise,
            drooping her head wearily. The next moment she ran and placed her
            hands on Madame Cerise's shoulders, peering into the round, beady
            eyes with tender pleading as she continued: &quot;I don't know why I
            have been stolen away from my home and friends; I don't know why
            this dreadful thing has happened to me; I only know that I am worn
            out and need rest. Will you take care of me, Madame Cerise? Will you
            watch over me while I sleep and guard me from all harm? I&mdash;I
            haven't any mother to lean on now, you know; I haven't any friend at
            all&mdash;but <i>you!</i>&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The grim features never relaxed a muscle; but a softer look came
            into the dark eyes and the woman's voice took on a faint tinge of
            compassion as she answered:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Nothing can harm ma'm'selle. Have no fear, <i>ma chere</i>. I
            will take care of you; I will watch. <i>Allons</i>! it is my duty;
            it is also my pleasure.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Are there no&mdash;no men in the house&mdash;none at all?&quot;
            enquired the girl, peering into the surrounding gloom nervously.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;There is no person at all in the house, but you and I.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And you will admit no one?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The woman hesitated.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Not to your apartment,&quot; she said firmly. &quot;I promise
            it.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise gave a long, fluttering sigh. Somehow, she felt that she
            could rely upon this promise.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Then, if you please, Madame Cerise, I'd like to go to bed,&quot;
            she said.
          </p>
          <p>
            The woman took the lamp and led the way upstairs, entering a large,
            airy chamber in which a fire burned brightly in the grate. The
            furniture here was dainty and feminine. In an alcove stood a snowy
            bed, the covers invitingly turned down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Madame Cerise set the lamp upon a table and without a word turned to
            assist Louise. The beautiful Kermess costume, elaborately
            embroidered with roses, which the girl still wore, evidently won the
            Frenchwoman's approval. She unhooked and removed it carefully and
            hung it in a closet. Very dextrous were her motions as she took down
            the girl's pretty hair and braided it for the night. A dainty <i>robe
            de nuit</i> was provided.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It is my own,&quot; she said simply. &quot;Ma'm'selle is not
            prepared.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But there must be young ladies in your family,&quot; remarked
            Louise, thoughtfully, for in spite of the stupor she felt from want
            of sleep the novelty of her position kept her alert in a way. It is
            true she was too tired and bewildered to think clearly, but slight
            details were impressing themselves upon her dimly. &quot;This room,
            for instance&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Of course, <i>ma chere</i>, a young lady has lived here. She
            has left some odd pieces of wardrobe behind her, at times, in going
            away. When you waken we will try to find a house-dress to replace
            your evening-gown. Will ma'm'selle indulge in the bath before
            retiring?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Not to-night, Madame Cerise. I'm too tired for anything but&mdash;sleep!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Indeed, she had no sooner crawled into the enticing bed than she
            sank into unconscious forgetfulness. This was to an extent
            fortunate. Louise possessed one of those dispositions cheery and
            equable under ordinary circumstances, but easily crushed into apathy
            by any sudden adversity. She would not suffer so much as a more
            excitable and nervous girl might do under similar circumstances.
          </p>
          <p>
            Her sleep, following the severe strain of the night's adventure, did
            little to refresh her. She awoke in broad daylight to hear a cold
            wind whistling shrilly outside and raindrops beating against the
            panes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Madame Cerise had not slept much during the night. For an hour after
            Louise retired she sat in her room in deep thought. Then she went to
            the telephone and notwithstanding the late hour called up Diana, who
            had a branch telephone on a table at her bedside.
          </p>
          <p>
            Miss Von Taer was not asleep. She had had an exciting night herself.
            She answered the old caretaker readily and it did not surprise her
            to learn that the missing girl had been taken to the East Orange
            house by the orders of Charlie Mershone. She enquired how Louise had
            accepted the situation forced upon her, and was shocked and rendered
            uncomfortable by the too plainly worded protest of the old
            Frenchwoman. Madame Cerise did not hesitate to denounce the
            abduction as a heartless crime, and in her communication with Diana
            swore she would protect the innocent girl from harm at the hands of
            Mershone or anyone else.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I have ever to your family been loyal and true, Ma'm'selle
            Diana,&quot; said she, &quot;but I will not become the instrument of
            an abominable crime at your command or that of your wicked cousin. I
            will keep the girl here in safety, if it is your wish; but she will
            be safe, indeed, as long as Cerise guards her.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That's right, Madame,&quot; stammered Diana, hardly knowing at
            the moment what to say. &quot;Be discreet and silent until you hear
            from me again; guard the girl carefully and see that she is not too
            unhappy; but for heaven's sake keep Charlie's secret until he sees
            fit to restore Miss Merrick to her friends. No crime is
            contemplated; I would not allow such a thing, as you know. Yet it is
            none of my affair whatever. My cousin has compromised me by taking
            the girl to my house, and no knowledge of the abduction must get
            abroad if we can help it. Do you understand me?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;No,&quot; was the reply. &quot;The safest way for us all is to
            send Miss Merrick away.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That will be done as soon as possible.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            With this the old Frenchwoman was forced to be content, and she did
            not suspect that her report had made Miss Von Taer nearly frantic
            with fear&mdash;not for Louise but for her own precious reputation.
            Accustomed to obey the family she had served for so many years,
            Madame Cerise hesitated to follow her natural impulse to set the
            poor young lady free and assist her to return to her friends. So she
            compromised with her conscience&mdash;a thing she was not credited
            with possessing&mdash;by resolving to make the imprisonment of the
            &quot;<i>pauvre fille</i>&quot; as happy as possible.
          </p>
          <p>
            Scarcely had Louise opened her eyes the following morning when the
            old woman entered her chamber, unlocking the door from the outside
            to secure admission.
          </p>
          <p>
            She first rebuilt the fire, and when it was crackling cheerfully she
            prepared a bath and brought an armful of clothing which she laid out
            for inspection over the back of a sofa. She produced lingerie, too,
            and Louise lay cuddled up in the bedclothes and watched her keeper
            thoughtfully until the atmosphere of the room was sufficiently
            warmed.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'll get up, now,&quot; she said, quietly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Madame Cerise was assuredly a skilled lady's maid. She bathed the
            girl, wrapped her in an ample kimono and then seated her before the
            dresser and arranged her <i>coiffure</i> with dextrous skill.
          </p>
          <p>
            During this time Louise talked. She had decided her only chance of
            escape lay in conciliating this stern-faced woman, and she began by
            relating her entire history, including her love affair with Arthur
            Weldon, Diana Von Taer's attempt to rob her of her lover, and the
            part that Charlie Mershone had taken in the affair.
          </p>
          <p>
            Madame Cerise listened, but said nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And now,&quot; continued the girl, &quot;tell me who you think
            could be so wicked and cruel as to carry me away from my home and
            friends? I cannot decide myself. You have more experience and more
            shrewdness, can't you tell me, Madame Cerise?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The woman muttered inaudibly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Mr. Mershone might be an enemy, because I laughed at his
            love-making,&quot; continued Louise, musingly. &quot;Would a man who
            loved a girl try to injure her? But perhaps his love has turned to
            hate. Anyhow, I can think of no one else who would do such a thing,
            or of any reason why Charlie Mershone should do it.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Madame Cerise merely grunted. She was brushing the soft hair with
            gentle care.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What could a man gain by stealing a girl? If it was Mr.
            Mershone, does he imagine I could ever forget Arthur? Or cease to
            love him? Or that Arthur would forget me while I am away? Perhaps
            it's Diana, and she wants to get rid of me so she can coax Arthur
            back to her side. But that's nonsense; isn't it, Madame Cerise? No
            girl&mdash;not even Diana Von Taer&mdash;would dare to act in such a
            high-handed manner toward her rival. Did you ever hear of Miss Von
            Taer? She's quite a society belle. Have you ever seen her, Madame
            Cerise?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The woman vouchsafed no reply to this direct enquiry, but busied
            herself dressing the girl's hair. Louise casually turned over the
            silver-mounted hand mirror she was holding and gave a sudden start.
            A monogram was engraved upon the metal: &quot;D.v.T.&quot; She gazed
            at the mark fixedly and then picked up a brush that the Frenchwoman
            laid down. Yes, the same monogram appeared upon the brush.
          </p>
          <p>
            The sharp eyes of Cerise had noted these movements. She was a little
            dismayed but not startled when Louise said, slowly: &quot;'D.v.T.'
            stands for Diana Von Taer. And it isn't likely to stand for anything
            else. I think the mystery is explained, now, and my worst fears are
            realized. Tell me, Madame, is this Diana Von Taer's house?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Her eyes shone with anger and round red patches suddenly appeared
            upon her pallid cheeks. Madame Cerise drew a long breath.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It used to be,&quot; was her quiet answer. &quot;It was left
            her by her grandmother; but Mr. Von Taer did not like the place and
            they have not been here lately&mdash;not for years. Miss Von Taer
            informed me, some time ago, that she had transferred the property to
            another.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;To her cousin&mdash;Mr. Mershone?&quot; asked Louise quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That may be the name; I cannot remember,&quot; was the evasive
            reply.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But you must know him, as he is Diana's cousin,&quot; retorted
            Louise. &quot;Why will you try to deceive me? Am I not helpless
            enough already, and do you wish to make me still more miserable?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I have seen Mr. Mershone when he was a boy, many times. He was
            not the favorite with Ma'm'selle Diana, nor with Monsieur Von Taer.
            For myself, I hated him.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            There was decided emphasis to the last sentence. Louise believed her
            and felt a little relieved.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the <i>m&eacute;lange</i> of apparel a modest outfit was
            obtained to clothe the girl with decency and comfort, if not in the
            prevailing style. The fit left much to be desired, yet Louise did
            not complain, as weightier matters were now occupying her mind.
          </p>
          <p>
            The toilet completed, Madame Cerise disappeared to get a tray
            containing a good breakfast. She seemed exceedingly attentive.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;If you will give me the proper directions I will start for
            home at once,&quot; announced Louise, with firm resolve, while
            eating her egg and toast.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I am unable to give you directions, and I cannot let you go,
            ma'm'selle,&quot; was the equally firm reply. &quot;The day is much
            too disagreeable to venture out in, unless one has proper
            conveyance. Here, alas, no conveyance may be had.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise tried other tactics.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I have no money, but several valuable jewels,&quot; she said,
            meaningly. &quot;I am quite sure they will obtain for me a
            conveyance.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You are wrong, ma'm'selle; there is no conveyance to be had!&quot;
            persisted the old woman, more sternly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Then I shall walk.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It is impossible.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Where is this place situated? How far is it from New York? How
            near am I to a street-car, or to a train?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I cannot tell you.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But this is absurd!&quot; cried Louise. &quot;You cannot
            deceive me for long. I know this is Diana Von Taer's house, and I
            shall hold Diana Von Taer responsible for this enforced
            imprisonment.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That,&quot; said Madame Cerise, coldly, &quot;is a matter of
            indifference to me. But ma'm'selle must understand one thing, she
            must not leave this house.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, indeed!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;At least, until the weather moderates,&quot; added the woman,
            more mildly.
          </p>
          <p>
            She picked up the tray, went to the door and passed out. Louise
            heard the key click in the lock.

            CHAPTER XVII
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            THE MYSTERY DEEPENS
          </p>
          <p>
            Uncle John was both astounded and indignant that so bold and
            unlawful an act as the abduction of his own niece could have been
            perpetrated in the heart of New York and directly under the eyes of
            the police. Urged by the Major, Mr. Merrick was at first inclined to
            allow Arthur Weldon to prosecute the affair and undertake the
            recovery of the girl, being assured this would easily be
            accomplished and conceding the fact that no one had a stronger
            interest in solving the mystery of Louise's disappearance than young
            Weldon. But when midday arrived and no trace of the young girl had
            yet been obtained the little millionaire assumed an important and
            decisive air and hurried down town to &quot;take a hand in the game&quot;
            himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            After a long interview with the Chief of Detectives, Mr. Merrick
            said impressively:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Now, understand, sir; not a hint of this to the newspaper
            folks. I won't have any scandal attached to the poor child if I can
            help it. Set your whole force to work&mdash;at once!&mdash;but
            impress them with the need of secrecy. My offer is fair and square.
            I'll give a reward of ten thousand dollars if Miss Merrick is
            discovered within twenty-four hours; nine thousand if she's found
            during the next twenty-four hours; and so on, deducting a thousand
            for each day of delay. That's for the officer who finds her. For
            yourself, sir, I intend to express my gratitude as liberally as the
            service will allow me to. Is this all clear and above-board?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It is perfectly clear, Mr. Merrick.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;The child must be found&mdash;and found blamed quick, too!
            Great Caesar! Can a simple affair like this baffle your splendid
            metropolitan force?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Not for long, Mr. Merrick, believe me.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            But this assurance proved optimistic. Day by day crept by without a
            clew to the missing girl being discovered; without development of
            any sort. The Inspector informed Mr. Merrick that &quot;it began to
            look like a mystery.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthur, even after several sleepless nights, still retained his
            courage.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm on the right track, sir,&quot; he told Uncle John. &quot;The
            delay is annoying, but not at all dangerous. So long as Fogerty
            holds fast to Mershone Louise is safe, wherever she may be.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Mershone may have nothing to do with the case.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm positive he has.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;And Louise can't be safe while she's a prisoner, and in the
            hands of strangers. I want the girl home! Then I'll know she's safe.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I want her home, too, sir. But all your men are unable to find
            her, it seems. They can't even discover in what direction she was
            taken, or how. The brown limousine seems to be no due at all.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Of course not. There are a thousand brown limousines in New
            York.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Do you imagine she's still somewhere in the city, sir?&quot;
            enquired Arthur.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That's my theory,&quot; replied Uncle John. &quot;She must be
            somewhere in the city. You see it would be almost impossible to get
            her out of town without discovery. But I'll admit this detective
            force is the finest aggregation of incompetents I've ever known&mdash;and
            I don't believe your precious Fogerty is any better, either.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course Beth and Patsy had to be told of their cousin's
            disappearance as soon as the first endeavor to trace her proved a
            failure. Patsy went at once to Mrs. Merrick and devoted herself to
            comforting the poor woman as well as she could.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beth frowned at the news and then sat down to carefully think out
            the problem. In an hour she had logically concluded that Diana Von
            Taer was the proper person to appeal to. If anyone knew where Louise
            was, it was Diana. That same afternoon she drove to the Von Taer
            residence and demanded an interview.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana was at that moment in a highly nervous state. She had at times
            during her career been calculating and unscrupulous, but never
            before had she deserved the accusation of being malicious and
            wicked. She had come to reproach herself bitterly for having weakly
            connived at the desperate act of Charlie Mershone, and her good
            sense assured her the result would be disastrous to all concerned in
            it. Contempt for herself and contempt for her cousin mingled with
            well-defined fears for her cherished reputation, and so it was that
            Miss Von Taer had almost decided to telephone Madame Cerise and
            order her to escort Louise Merrick to her own home when Beth's card
            came up with a curt demand for a personal interview.
          </p>
          <p>
            The natures of these two girls had never harmonized in the slightest
            degree. Beth's presence nerved Diana to a spirit of antagonism that
            quickly destroyed her repentant mood. As she confronted her visitor
            her demeanor was cold and suspicious. There was a challenge and an
            accusation in Beth's eyes that conveyed a distinct warning, which
            Miss Von Taer quickly noted and angrily resented&mdash;perhaps
            because she knew it was deserved.
          </p>
          <p>
            It would have been easy to tell Beth De Graf where her cousin Louise
            was, and at the same time to assure her that Diana was blameless in
            the affair; but she could not endure to give her antagonist this
            satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beth began the interview by saying: &quot;What have you done with
            Louise Merrick?&quot; That was, of course, equal to a declaration of
            war.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana was sneering and scornful. Thoroughly on guard, she permitted
            no compromising word or admission to escape her. Really, she knew
            nothing of Louise Merrick, having unfortunately neglected to examine
            her antecedents and personal characteristics before undertaking her
            acquaintance. One is so likely to blunder through excess of good
            nature. She had supposed a niece of Mr. John Merrick would be of the
            right sort; but the age is peculiar, and one cannot be too cautious
            in choosing associates. If Miss Merrick had run away from her home
            and friends, Miss Von Taer was in no way responsible for the
            escapade. And now, if Miss De Graf had nothing further to say, more
            important matters demanded Diana's time.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beth was furious with anger at this baiting. Without abandoning a
            jot her suspicions she realized she was powerless to prove her case
            at this time. With a few bitter and cutting remarks&mdash; made, she
            afterward said, in &quot;self-defense&quot;&mdash;she retreated as
            gracefully as possible and drove home.
          </p>
          <p>
            An hour later she suggested to Uncle John that he have a detective
            placed where Diana's movements could be watched; but that had
            already been attended to by both Mr. Merrick and Mr. Fogerty. Uncle
            John could hardly credit Diana's complicity in this affair. The
            young lady's social position was so high, her family so eminently
            respectable, her motive in harming Louise so inconceivable, that he
            hesitated to believe her guilty, even indirectly. As for her cousin,
            he did not know what to think, as Arthur accused him unreservedly.
            It did not seem possible that any man of birth, breeding and social
            position could be so contemptible as to perpetrate an act of this
            character. Yet some one had done it, and who had a greater incentive
            than Charlie Mershone?
          </p>
          <p>
            Poor Mrs. Merrick was inconsolable as the days dragged by. She clung
            to Patsy with pitiful entreaties not to be left alone; so Miss Doyle
            brought her to her own apartments, where the bereft woman was shown
            every consideration. Vain and selfish though Mrs. Merrick might be,
            she was passionately devoted to her only child, and her fears for
            the life and safety of Louise were naturally greatly exaggerated.
          </p>
          <p>
            The group of anxious relatives and friends canvassed the subject
            morning, noon and night, and the longer the mystery remained
            unsolved the more uneasy they all became.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;This, ma'am,&quot; said Uncle John, sternly, as he sat one
            evening facing Mrs. Merrick, &quot;is the final result of your
            foolish ambition to get our girls into society.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I can't see it that way, John,&quot; wailed the poor woman.
            &quot;I've never heard of such a thing happening in society before,
            have you?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I don't keep posted,&quot; he growled. &quot;But everything
            was moving smoothly with us before this confounded social stunt
            began, as you must admit.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I can't understand why the papers are not full of it,&quot;
            sighed Mrs. Merrick, musingly. &quot;Louise is so prominent now in
            the best circles.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Of course,&quot; said the Major, drily; &quot;she's so
            prominent, ma'am, that no one can discover her at all! And it's
            lucky for us the newspapers know nothing of the calamity. They'd
            twist the thing into so many shapes that not one of us would ever
            again dare to look a friend in the eye.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm sure my darling has been murdered!&quot; declared Mrs.
            Merrick, weeping miserably. She made the statement on an average of
            once to every five minutes. &quot;Or, if she hasn't been killed yet,
            she's sure to be soon. Can't <i>something</i> be done?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            That last appeal was hard to answer. They had done everything that
            could be thought of. And here it was Tuesday. Louise had been
            missing for five days.

            CHAPTER XVIII
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            A RIFT IN THE CLOUDS
          </p>
          <br />
          <p>
            The Tuesday morning just referred to dawned cold and wintry. A chill
            wind blew and for a time carried isolated snowflakes whirling here
            and there. Gradually, as the morning advanced, the flakes became
            more numerous, until by nine o'clock an old fashioned snowstorm had
            set in that threatened to last for some time. The frozen ground was
            soon covered with a thin white mantle and the landscape in city and
            country seemed especially forbidding.
          </p>
          <p>
            In spite of these adverse conditions Charlie Mershone decided to go
            out for a walk. He felt much like a prisoner, and his only
            recreation was in getting out of the hotel for a daily stroll.
            Moreover, he had an object in going abroad to-day.
          </p>
          <p>
            So he buttoned his overcoat up to his chin and fearlessly braved the
            storm. He had come to wholly disregard the presence of the detective
            who shadowed him, and if the youthful Fogerty by chance addressed
            him he was rewarded with a direct snub. This did not seem to
            disconcert the boy in the least, and to-day, as usual, when Mershone
            walked out Fogerty followed at a respectful distance. He never
            appeared to be watching his man closely, yet never for an instant
            did Mershone feel that he had shaken the fellow off.
          </p>
          <p>
            On this especial morning the detective was nearly a block in the
            rear, with the snow driving furiously into his face, when an
            automobile suddenly rolled up to the curb beside him and two men
            leaped out and pinioned Fogerty in their arms. There was no
            struggle, because there was no resistance. The captors quickly
            tossed the detective into the car, an open one, which again started
            and turned into a side street.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fogerty, seated securely between the two burly fellows, managed to
            straighten up and rearrange his clothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Will you kindly explain this unlawful act, gentlemen?&quot; he
            enquired.
          </p>
          <p>
            The man on the left laughed aloud. He was the same individual who
            had attacked Arthur Weldon, the one who had encountered Mershone in
            the street the day before.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Cold day, ain't it, Fogerty?&quot; he remarked. &quot;But that
            makes it all the better for a little auto ride. We like you, kid,
            we're fond of you&mdash;awful fond&mdash;ain't we, Pete?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;We surely are,&quot; admitted the other.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;So we thought we'd invite you out for a whirl&mdash;see? We'll
            give you a nice ride, so you can enjoy the scenery. It's fine out
            Harlem way, an' the cold'll make you feel good. Eh, Pete?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That's the idea,&quot; responded Pete, cheerfully.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Very kind of you,&quot; said the detective, leaning back
            comfortably against the cushions and pulling up his coat collar to
            shield him from the wind. &quot;But are you aware that I'm on duty,
            and that this will allow my man to slip away from me?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Can't help that; but we're awful sorry,&quot; was the reply.
            &quot;We just wanted company, an' you're a good fellow, Fogerty,
            considerin' your age an' size.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Thank you,&quot; said Fogerty, &quot;You know me, and I know
            you. You are Bill Leesome, alias Will Dutton&mdash;usually called
            Big Bill. You did time a couple of years ago for knocking out a
            policeman.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm safe enough now, though,&quot; responded Big Bill. &quot;You're
            not working on the reg'lar force, Fogerty, you're only a private
            burr.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I am protected, just the same,&quot; asserted Fogerty. &quot;When
            you knabbed me I was shadowing Mershone, who has made away with a
            prominent society young lady.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, he has, has he?&quot; chuckled Big Bill, and his companion
            laughed so gleefully that he attracted Fogerty's attention to
            himself.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Ah, I suppose you are one of the two men who lugged the girl
            off,&quot; he remarked; &quot;and I must congratulate you on having
            made a good job of it. Isn't it curious, by the way, that the fellow
            who stole and hid this girl should be the innocent means of
            revealing her biding place?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The two men stared at him blankly. The car, during this
            conversation, had moved steadily on, turning this and that corner in
            a way that might have confused anyone not perfectly acquainted with
            this section of the city.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What d'ye mean by that talk, Fogerty?&quot; demanded Big Bill.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Of course it was Mershone who stole the girl,&quot; explained
            the detective, calmly; &quot;we know that. But Mershone is a clever
            chap. He knew he was watched, and so he has never made a movement to
            go to his prisoner. But he grew restless in time, and when he met
            you, yesterday, fixed up a deal with you to carry me away, so he
            could escape.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Big Bill looked uncomfortable.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You know a lot, Fogerty,&quot; he said, doggedly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes; I've found that human nature is much the same the world
            over,&quot; replied the detective. &quot;Of course I suspected you
            would undertake to give Mershone his chance by grabbing me, and that
            is exactly what you have done. But, my lads, what do you suppose I
            have done in the meantime?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            They both looked their curiosity but said nothing.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I've simply used your clever plot to my own advantage, in
            order to bring things to a climax,&quot; continued Fogerty. &quot;While
            we are joy-riding here, a half dozen of my men are watching every
            move that Mershone makes. I believe he will lead them straight to
            the girl; don't you?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Big Bill growled some words that were not very choice and then
            yelled to the chauffeur to stop. The other man was pale and
            evidently frightened.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;See here, Fogerty; you make tracks!&quot; was the sharp
            command, as the automobile came to a halt. &quot;You've worked a
            pretty trick on us, 'cordin' to your own showin', and we must find
            Mr. Mershone before it's too late&mdash;if we can.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Good morning,&quot; said Fogerty, alighting. &quot;Thank you
            for a pleasant ride&mdash;and other things.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            They dashed away and left him standing on the curb; and after
            watching them disappear the detective walked over to a drug store
            and entered the telephone booth.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That you, Hyde?&mdash;This is Fogerty.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes, sir. Mr. Mershone has just crossed the ferry to Jersey.
            Adams is with him. I'll hear from him again in a minute: hold the
            wire.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Fogerty waited. Soon he learned that Mershone had purchased a ticket
            for East Orange. The train would leave in fifteen minutes.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fogerty decided quickly. After looking at his watch he rushed out
            and arrested a passing taxicab.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Ready for a quick run&mdash;perhaps a long one?&quot; he
            asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Ready for anything,&quot; declared the man.
          </p>
          <p>
            The detective jumped in and gave hurried directions.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Never mind the speed limit,&quot; he said. &quot;No one will
            interfere with us. I'm Fogerty.&quot;

            CHAPTER XIX
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            POLITIC REPENTANCE
          </p>
          <p>
            Perhaps no one&mdash;not even Mrs. Merrick&mdash;was so unhappy in
            consequence of the lamentable crime that had been committed as Diana
            Von Taer. Immediately after her interview with Beth her mood
            changed, and she would have given worlds to be free from complicity
            in the abduction. Bitterly, indeed, she reproached herself for her
            enmity toward the unsuspecting girl, an innocent victim of Diana's
            own vain desires and Charles Mershone's heartless wiles. Repenting
            her folly and reasoning out the thing when it was too late, Diana
            saw clearly that she had gained no possible advantage, but had
            thoughtlessly conspired to ruin the reputation of an honest,
            ingenuous girl.
          </p>
          <p>
            Not long ago she had said that her life was dull, a stupid round of
            social functions that bored her dreadfully. She had hoped by
            adopting John Merrick's nieces as her <i>prot&eacute;g&eacute;es</i>
            and introducing them to society to find a novel and pleasurable
            excitement that would serve to take her out of her unfortunate <i>ennui</i>&mdash;a
            condition to which she had practically been born.
          </p>
          <p>
            But Diana had never bargained for such excitement as this; she had
            never thought to win self abhorrence by acts of petty malice and
            callous cruelties.
          </p>
          <p>
            Yet so intrenched was she in the conservatism of her class that she
            could not at once bring herself to the point of exposing her own
            guilt that she might make amends for what had been done. She told
            herself she would rather die than permit Louise to suffer through
            her connivance with her reckless, unprincipled cousin. She realized
            perfectly that she ought to fly, without a moment's delay, to the
            poor girl's assistance. Yet fear of exposure, of ridicule, of loss
            of caste, held her a helpless prisoner in her own home, where she
            paced the floor and moaned and wrung her hands until she was on the
            verge of nervous prostration. If at any time she seemed to acquire
            sufficient courage to go to Louise, a glance at the detective
            watching the house unnerved her and prevented her from carrying out
            her good intentions.
          </p>
          <p>
            You must not believe that Diana was really bad; her lifelong
            training along set lines and practical seclusion from the everyday
            world were largely responsible for her evil impulses. Mischief is
            sure to crop up, in one form or another, among the idle and
            ambitionless. More daring wickedness is said to be accomplished by
            the wealthy and aimless creatures of our false society than by the
            poorer and uneducated classes, wherein criminals are supposed to
            thrive. These sins are often unpublished, although not always
            undiscovered, but they are no more venial because they are
            suppressed by wealth and power.
          </p>
          <p>
            Diana Von Taer was a girl who, rightly led, might have been capable
            of developing a noble womanhood; yet the conditions of her limited
            environment had induced her to countenance a most dastardly and
            despicable act. It speaks well for the innate goodness of this girl
            that she at last actually rebelled and resolved to undo, insofar as
            she was able, the wrong that had been accomplished.
          </p>
          <p>
            For four days she suffered tortures of remorse. On the morning of
            the fifth day she firmly decided to act. Regardless of who might be
            watching, or of any unpleasant consequences to herself, she quietly
            left the house, unattended, and started directly for the East Orange
            mansion.

            CHAPTER XX
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            A TELEPHONE CALL
          </p>
          <p>
            Still another laggard awoke to action on this eventful Tuesday
            morning.
          </p>
          <p>
            Madame Cerise had been growing more and more morose and dissatisfied
            day by day. Her grievance was very tangible. A young girl had been
            brought forcibly to the house and placed in her care to be treated
            as a prisoner. From that time the perpetrators of the deed had left
            the woman to her own resources, never communicating with her in any
            way.
          </p>
          <p>
            During a long life of servitude Madame Cerise had acquiesced in many
            things that her own conscience did not approve of, for she
            considered herself a mere instrument to be used at will by the
            people who employed and paid her. But her enforced solitude as
            caretaker of the lonely house at East Orange had given her ample
            time to think, and her views had lately undergone a decided change.
          </p>
          <p>
            To become the jailer of a young, pretty and innocent girl was the
            most severe trial her faithfulness to her employers had ever
            compelled her to undergo, and the woman deeply resented the doubtful
            position in which she had been placed.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, the chances were that Madame Cerise might have obeyed her
            orders to the letter had not so long a period of waiting ensued.
            During these days she was constantly thrown in the society of
            Louise, which had a tendency to make her still more rebellious. The
            girl clung to Cerise in her helplessness and despair, and constantly
            implored her to set her free. This, indeed, the Frenchwoman might
            have done long ago had she not suspected such an act might cause
            great embarrassment to Diana Von Taer, whom she had held on her knee
            as an infant and sought to protect with loyal affection.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was hard, though, to hear the pitiful appeals of the imprisoned
            girl, and to realize how great was the wrong that was being done
            her. The old woman was forced to set her jaws firmly and turn deaf
            ears to the pleadings in order not to succumb to them straightway.
            Meantime she did her duty conscientiously. She never left Louise's
            room without turning the key in the lock, and she steadfastly
            refused the girl permission to wander in the other rooms of the
            house. The prison was a real prison, indeed, but the turnkey sought
            to alleviate the prisoner's misery by every means in her power. She
            was indefatigable in her service, keeping the room warm and neat,
            attending to the girl's every want and cooking her delicious meals.
          </p>
          <p>
            While this all tended to Louise's comfort it had little affect in
            soothing her misery. Between periods of weeping she sought to cajole
            the old woman to release her, and at times she succumbed to blank
            despair. Arthur was always in her mind, and she wondered why he did
            not come to rescue her. Every night she stole softly from her bed to
            try the door, hoping Cerise had forgotten to lock it. She examined
            her prison by stealth to discover any possible way of escape.
          </p>
          <p>
            There were two small windows and one large one. The latter opened
            upon the roof of a small porch, but, there were no way to descend
            from it unless one used a frail lattice at one end, which in summer
            probably supported a rose or other vine. Louise shrank intuitively
            from such a desperate undertaking. Unless some dreadful crisis
            occurred she would never dare trust herself to that frail support.
            Yet it seemed the only possible way of escape.
          </p>
          <p>
            Time finally wore out the patience of Madame Cerise, who was unable
            longer to withstand Louise's pleadings. She did not indicate by word
            or look that her attitude had changed, but she made a secret resolve
            to have done with the affair altogether.
          </p>
          <p>
            Often in their conversations the girl had mentioned Arthur Weldon.
            She had given Cerise his address and telephone number, and implored
            her at least to communicate with him and tell him his sweetheart was
            safe, although unhappy. This had given the old woman the clever idea
            on which she finally acted.
          </p>
          <p>
            By telephoning Mr. Weldon she could give him the information that
            would lead to his coming for Louise, without anyone knowing who it
            was that had betrayed the secret. This method commended itself
            strongly to her, as it would save her from any trouble or reproach.
          </p>
          <p>
            Leaving Louise at breakfast on this Tuesday morning Madame Cerise
            went down to the telephone and was soon in communication with
            Arthur. She told him, in a quiet tone, that Miss Louise Merrick was
            being secluded in a suburban house near East Orange, and described
            the place so he could easily find it. The young man questioned her
            eagerly, but aside from the information that the girl was well and
            uninjured she vouchsafed no further comment.
          </p>
          <p>
            It was enough, however. Arthur, in wild excitement, rushed to the
            rescue.

          <p>
            THE UNEXPECTED HAPPENS
          </p>
          <p>
            Madame Cerise, well knowing she had accelerated the march of events
            to a two-step, calmly sat herself down in the little housekeeper's
            room off the lower hall and, leaving Louise to her moody solitude
            upstairs, awaited the inevitable developments.
          </p>
          <p>
            Outside the weather was cold and blustering. The wind whirled its
            burden of snowflakes in every direction with blinding, bewildering
            impartiality. It was a bad day to be out, thought the old
            Frenchwoman; but a snowstorm was not likely to deter an anxious
            lover. She calculated the time it would take Monsieur Weldon to
            arrive at the mansion: if he was prompt and energetic he could cover
            the distance in an hour and a half by train or three hours by motor
            car. But he must prepare for the journey, and that would consume
            some time; perhaps she need not expect him within two hours at the
            earliest.
          </p>
          <p>
            She read, to pass away the time, selecting a book from a shelf of
            well-worn French novels. Somehow she did not care to face her
            tearful prisoner again until she could restore the unhappy girl to
            the arms of her true lover. There was still romance in the soul of
            Madame Cerise, however withered her cheeks might be. She was very
            glad that at last she had summoned courage to act according to the
            dictates of her heart.
          </p>
          <p>
            Eh? What is this? A rumble of wheels over the frozen snow caused her
            to glance at the clock above the mantel. Not by any possibility
            could Monsieur Weldon arrive so soon. Who, then, could it be?
          </p>
          <p>
            She sat motionless while the doorbell rang, and rang again. Nothing
            must interfere with the pretty <i>denouement</i> she had so fondly
            anticipated when Louise's faithful knight came to her.
          </p>
          <p>
            But the one who had just now alighted was persistent. The vehicle
            had been sent away&mdash;she heard the sound of receding wheels&mdash;and
            the new arrival wanted to get in. The bell jerked and jangled
            unceasingly for a time and then came a crash against the door, as if
            a stalwart shoulder was endeavoring to break it down.
          </p>
          <p>
            Madame Cerise laid down her book, placed her <i>pince-nez</i> in the
            case, and slowly proceeded down the hall. The door shook with
            another powerful impact, a voice cried out demanding admittance.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Who is it, then?&quot; she called shrilly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Open the door, confound you!&quot; was the irritated reply.
          </p>
          <p>
            The woman reflected. This was surely young Mershone's voice. And she
            had no excuse to deny him admittance. Quietly she unbolted the door
            and allowed it to open an inch while she peered at the man outside.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh! it is Monsieur Mershone.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Of course it is,&quot; he roared, forcing the door open and
            stalking in. &quot;Who in thunder did you think it was?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;A thousand pardons, m'sieur,&quot; said Cerise. &quot;I must
            be cautious; it is your own command. That you may be protected I
            deny admittance to all.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That's all right,&quot; said Mershone gruffly, while he
            stamped his feet upon the rug and shook the snow from his clothing.
            &quot;Haven't you any fire in this beastly old refrigerator? I'm
            nearly frozen. Where's Miss Merrick?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;She is occupying Ma'm'selle Diana's room, in the west wing.
            Will monsieur please to come this way?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            She led him to her own little room, and so engrossed were they that
            neither remembered he had failed to rebolt the front door.
          </p>
          <p>
            A good fire burned in the grate of Cerise's cosy den and Mershone
            threw off his overcoat and warmed his hands as he showered questions
            upon the old caretaker.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;How is the girl behaving? Tears and hysterics?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;At times, m'sieur.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Takes it hard, eh?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;She is very unhappy.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Ever mention a man named Weldon?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Often.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Humph!&quot; He did not like this report. &quot;Has anyone
            been here to disturb you, or to make enquiries?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;No one, m'sieur.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;We're safe enough, I guess. It was a mighty neat job, Cerise,
            taken altogether, although the fools have been watching me night and
            day. That's the reason I did not come sooner.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            She made no comment. Mershone threw himself into a chair and stared
            thoughtfully at the fire.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Has Louise&mdash;Miss Merrick, you know&mdash;mentioned my
            name at all?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;At times.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;In what way?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;With loathing and contempt.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            He scowled at her savagely.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Do you think she suspects that I carried her away?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;She seems to know it absolutely.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            He stared at the fire again.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I've got a queer job on my hands, Cerise, and I rely on you to
            help me,&quot; said he presently, assuming a more conciliating
            manner. &quot;Perhaps I'm in a box, or a hole, or whatever else you
            like to call it, but it's too late too back down now&mdash;I must
            push ahead and win. You see the case is this: I love the girl and
            had her brought here to keep her from another man. By hook or crook
            I'm going to make her my wife. She won't take kindly to that at
            first, perhaps, but I'll make her happy in the end. In one way this
            delay has been a good thing. It must have worn her out and broken
            her spirits quite a bit; eh?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;She seems very miserable,&quot; conceded the woman.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Do you find her hard to manage? Does she show much temper? In
            other words, do you suppose she'll put up a fight?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Madame Cerise regarded him wonderingly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;She is a good girl,&quot; was her reply. &quot;She loves with
            much devotion the man from whom you have stolen her. I am quite
            positive she will never consent to become your wife.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, you are? Well, I intend she shall marry me, and that
            settles it. She's unnerved and miserable now, and I mean to grind
            her down till she hasn't strength to resist me. That sounds hard. I
            know; but it's the only way to accomplish my purpose. After she's my
            wife I'll be very kind to her, poor thing, and teach her to love me.
            A man can do anything with a woman if he sets about it the right
            way. I'm not taking this stand because I'm cruel, Cerise, but
            because I'm desperate. All's fair in love and war, you know, and
            this is a bit of both.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            He was pacing the floor by this time, his hands thrust deep in his
            pockets, an anxious look upon his face that belied his bombastic
            words.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Frenchwoman's expression was impassive. Her scorn for the wretch
            before her was tempered with the knowledge that his cowardly plan
            was doomed to defeat. It was she who had checkmated him, and she was
            glad. Now and again her eyes sought the clock, while she silently
            calculated the time to elapse before Arthur Weldon arrived. There
            would be a pretty scene then, Cerise would have much enjoyment in
            witnessing the encounter.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Now, then, take me to Louise,&quot; commanded Mershone,
            suddenly.
          </p>
          <p>
            She shrank back in dismay.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, not yet, m'sieur!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why not?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;The young lady is asleep. She will not waken for an hour&mdash;perhaps
            two.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I can't wait. We'll waken her now, and give her an idea of the
            change of program.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But no, m'sieur! It is outrageous. The poor thing has but now
            sobbed herself to sleep, after many bitter hours. Can you not wait a
            brief hour, having waited five days?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;No. Take me to her at once.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            As he came toward her the woman drew away.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I cannot,&quot; she said firmly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;See here, Cerise, I intend to be obeyed. I won't endure any
            nonsense at this stage of the game, believe me,&quot; he announced
            fiercely. &quot;In order to win, there's just one way to manage this
            affair, and I insist upon your following my instructions. Take me to
            Louise!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I will not!&quot; she returned, the bead-like eyes glittering
            as they met his angry gaze.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Then I'll go alone. Give me the key.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            She did not move, nor did she answer him. At her waist hung a small
            bunch of household keys and this he seized with a sudden movement
            and jerked loose from its cord.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You miserable hag!&quot; he muttered, inflamed with anger at
            her opposition. &quot;If you propose to defend this girl and defy
            me, you'll find I'm able to crush you as I will her. While I'm gone
            I expect you to come to your senses, and decide to obey me.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            With these words he advanced to the door of the little room and
            opened it. Just outside stood Fogerty, smiling genially.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Glad to meet you again, Mr. Mershone,&quot; he said. &quot;May
            I come in? Thank you.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            While Mershone stood bewildered by this unexpected apparition the
            detective entered the room, closed the door carefully, and putting
            his back to it bowed politely to Madame Cerise.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Pardon this seeming intrusion, ma'am,&quot; said he. &quot;I'm
            here on a little matter of business, having a warrant for the arrest
            of Mr. Charles Connoldy Mershone.&quot;
          </p>
          <hr style="width: 35%;" />

          <h2>
            CHAPTER XXII
          </h2>
          <p>
            GONE
          </p>
          <p>
            The grim face of Madame Cerise relaxed to allow a quaint smile to
            flit across it. She returned Fogerty's bow with a deep curtsy.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone, after one brief exclamation of dismay, wrested from him by
            surprise, threw himself into the chair again and stared at the fire.
            For a few moments there was intense stillness in the little room.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;How easy it is,&quot; said Fogerty, in soft, musing tones,
            &quot;to read one's thoughts&mdash;under certain circumstances. You
            are thinking, Mr. Mershone, that I'm a boy, and not very strong,
            while you are an athlete and can easily overpower me. I have come at
            a disagreeable time, and all your plans depend on your ability to
            get rid of me. But I've four good men within call, who are just now
            guarding the approaches to this house. They'd like to come in, I
            know, because it's very cold and disagreeable outside; but suppose
            we allow them to freeze for a time? Ah, I thought you'd agree with
            me, sir&mdash;I overheard you say you were about to visit Miss
            Merrick, who is confined in a room upstairs, but I'd like you to
            postpone that while we indulge in a little confidential chat
            together. You see&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The door-bell rang violently. Fogerty glanced at Madame Cerise.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Will you see who it is?&quot; he asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            She arose at once and left the room. Mershone turned quickly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What's your price, Fogerty?&quot; he asked, meaningly.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;For what?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;For getting out of here&mdash;making tracks and leaving me
            alone. Every man has his price, and I'm trapped&mdash;I'm willing to
            pay anything&mdash;I'll&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Cut it out, sir. You've tried this once before. I'm not to be
            bribed.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Have you really a warrant for my arrest?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I've carried it since Friday. It's no use, Mershone, the
            game's up and you may as well grin and bear it.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone was about to reply when the door opened and Diana Von Taer
            came in with a swift, catlike tread and confronted him with flaming
            eyes.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You coward! You low, miserable scoundrel! How dare you come
            here to annoy and browbeat that poor girl?&quot; she cried in clear,
            cutting accents, without noticing the presence of Fogerty.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Oh, shut up, Di, you're in it as deep as I am,&quot; he
            retorted, turning away with a flushed face.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I'm not, sir! Never have I countenanced this wicked, criminal
            act,&quot; she declared. &quot;I have come here to-day to save
            Louise from your wiles and carry her back to her friends. I dare
            you, or your confederates,&quot; with a scornful look at the
            detective, &quot;to interfere with me in any way.&quot; Then she
            turned to Cerise and continued: &quot;Where is Miss Merrick now?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;In your own room, ma'm'seile.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Come with me, then.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            With a defiant glance at Mershone she turned haughtily and left the
            room. Cerise followed obediently, somewhat astonished at the queer
            turn of events.
          </p>
          <p>
            Left alone with Mershone, Fogerty chuckled gleefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Why, it seems I wasn't needed, after all,&quot; said he,
            &quot;and we've both of us taken a lot of trouble for nothing,
            Mershone. The chances are Miss Von Taer would have turned the trick
            in any event, don't you think so?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;No, you don't understand her. She wouldn't have interfered if
            she hadn't been scared out,&quot; growled the other. &quot;She's
            sacrificed me to save herself, that's all.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You may be right about that,&quot; admitted Fogerty; and then
            he got up to answer the door-bell, which once more rang violently.
          </p>
          <p>
            An automobile stood outside, and from it an excited party trooped
            into the hallway, disregarding the cutting wind and blinding
            snowflakes that assailed them as they passed in. There was Arthur
            Weldon and Uncle John, Patricia and Beth; and all, as they saw the
            detective, cried with one voice:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Where's Louise?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Fogerty had just managed to close the door against the wintry blast
            when the answer came from the stairway just above:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;She is gone!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The voice was shrill and despairing, and looking up they saw Diana
            standing dramatically posed upon the landing, her hands clasped over
            her heart and a look of fear upon her face. Over her shoulder the
            startled black eyes of old Cerise peered down upon the group below.
          </p>
          <p>
            The newcomers were evidently bewildered by this reception. They had
            come to rescue Louise, whom they imagined confined in a lonely
            deserted villa with no companion other than the woman who guarded
            her. Arthur's own detective opened the door to them and Diana Von
            Taer, whom they certainly did not expect to meet here, confronted
            them with the thrilling statement that Louise had gone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthur was the first to recover his wits.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Gone!&quot; he repeated; &quot;gone where?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;She had escaped&mdash;run away!&quot; explained Diana, in real
            distress.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;When?&quot; asked Uncle John.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Just now. Within an hour, wasn't it, Cerise?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;At ten o'clock I left her, now she is gone,&quot; said the old
            woman, who appeared as greatly agitated as her mistress.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Good gracious! you don't mean to say she's left the house in
            this storm?&quot; exclaimed Patsy, aghast at the very thought.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What shall we do? What <i>can</i> we do?&quot; demanded Beth,
            eagerly.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fogerty started up the stairs. Cerise turned to show him the way,
            and the others followed in an awed group.
          </p>
          <p>
            The key was in the lock of the door to the missing girl's room, but
            the door itself now stood ajar. Fogerty entered, cast a sharp look
            around and walked straight to the window. As the others came in,
            glancing curiously about them and noting the still smouldering fire
            and the evidences of recent occupation, the detective unlatched the
            French window and stepped out into the snow that covered the roof of
            the little porch below. Arthur sprang out beside him, leaving the
            rest to shiver in the cold blast that rushed in upon them from the
            open window.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fogerty, on his knees, scanned the snow carefully, and although
            Weldon could discover no sign of a footprint the young detective
            nodded his head sagaciously and slowly made his way to the trellis
            at the end. Here it was plain that the accumulation of snow had
            recently been brushed away from the frail framework.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It was strong enough to hold her, though,&quot; declared
            Fogerty, looking over the edge of the roof. &quot;I'll descend the
            same way, sir. Go back by the stairs and meet me below.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            He grasped the lattice and began cautiously to lower himself to the
            ground, and Arthur turned to rejoin his friends in the room.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That is the way she escaped, without doubt,&quot; he said to
            them. &quot;Poor child, she had no idea we were about to rescue her,
            and her long confinement had made her desperate.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Did she have a cloak, or any warm clothes?&quot; asked Beth.
            Madame Cerise hurriedly examined the wardrobe in the closets.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes, ma'm'selle; she has taken a thick coat and a knit scarf,&quot;
            she answered. But I am sure she had no gloves, and her shoes were
            very thin.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;How long do you think she has been gone?&quot; Patsy enquired.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Not more than an hour. I was talking with Mr. Mershone, and&mdash;&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Mershone! Is he here?&quot; demanded Arthur.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;He is in my room downstairs&mdash;or was when you came,&quot;
            said the woman.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That accounts for her sudden flight,&quot; declared the young
            man, bitterly. &quot;She doubtless heard his voice and in a sudden
            panic decided to fly. Did Mershone see her?&quot; he asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;No, m'sieur,&quot; replied Cerise.
          </p>
          <p>
            With one accord they descended to the lower hall and the caretaker
            led the way to her room. To their surprise they found Mershone still
            seated in the chair by the fire, his hands clasped behind his head,
            a cigarette between his lips.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Here is another crime for you to account for!&quot; cried
            Arthur, advancing upon him angrily. &quot;You have driven Louise to
            her death!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone raised one hand in mild protest.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Don't waste time cursing me,&quot; he said. &quot;Try to find
            Louise before it is too late.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The reproach seemed justified. Arthur paused and turning to Mr.
            Merrick said:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;He is right. I'll go help Fogerty, and you must stay here and
            look after the girls until we return.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            As he went out he passed Diana without a look. She sat in a corner
            of the room sobbing miserably. Beth was thoughtful and quiet, Patsy
            nervous and indignant. Uncle John was apparently crushed by the
            disaster that had overtaken them. Mershone's suggestion that Louise
            might perish in the storm was no idle one; the girl was not only
            frail and delicate but worn out with her long imprisonment and its
            anxieties. They all realized this.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I believe,&quot; said Mershone, rising abruptly, &quot;I'll go
            and join the search. Fogerty has arrested me, but you needn't worry
            about my trying to escape. I don't care what becomes of me, now, and
            I'm going straight to join the detective.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            They allowed him to go without protest, and he buttoned his coat and
            set out in the storm to find the others. Fogerty and Arthur were by
            this time in the lane back of the grounds, where the detective was
            advancing slowly with his eyes fixed on the ground.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;The tracks are faint, but easily followed,&quot; he was
            saying, &quot;The high heels of her shoes leave a distinct mark.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            When Mershone joined them Arthur scowled at the fellow but said
            nothing. Fogerty merely smiled.
          </p>
          <p>
            From the lane the tracks, already nearly obliterated by the fast
            falling snow, wandered along nearly a quarter of a mile to a
            crossroads, where they became wholly lost.
          </p>
          <p>
            Fogerty looked up and down the roads and shook his head with a
            puzzled expression.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;We've surely traced her so far,&quot; said he, &quot;but now
            we must guess at her further direction. You'll notice this track of
            a wagon. It may have passed fifteen minutes or an hour ago. The hoof
            tracks of the horses are covered, so I'm not positive which way they
            headed; I only know there are indications of hoof tracks, which
            proves it a farmer's wagon. The question is, whether the young lady
            met it, and caught a ride, or whether she proceeded along some of
            the other trails. I can't find any indication of those high-heeled
            shoes from this point, in any direction. Better get your car, Mr.
            Weldon, and run east a few miles, keeping sharp watch of the wagon
            tracks on the way. It was a heavy wagon, for the wheels cut deep.
            Mershone and I will go west. When you've driven far enough to
            satisfy yourself you're going the wrong direction, you may easily
            overtake us on your return. Then, if we've discovered nothing on
            this road, we'll try the other.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthur ran back at once to the house and in a few minutes had
            started on his quest. The motor car was powerful enough to plow
            through the deep snow with comparative ease.
          </p>
          <p>
            Those left together in Madam Cerise's little room were more to be
            pitied than the ones engaged in active search, for there was nothing
            to relieve their fears and anxieties. Diana, unable to bear the
            accusing looks of Patsy and Beth, resolved to make a clean breast of
            her complicity in the affair and related to them every detail of her
            connection with her cousin's despicable plot. She ended by begging
            their forgiveness, and wept so miserably that Uncle John found
            himself stroking her hair while Patsy came close and pressed the
            penitent girl's hand as if to comfort and reassure her.
          </p>
          <p>
            Beth said nothing. She could not find it in her heart as yet to
            forgive Diana's selfish conspiracy against her cousin's happiness.
            If Louise perished in this dreadful storm the proud Diana Von Taer
            could not escape the taint of murder. The end was not yet.

          <br />
          <p>
            THE CRISIS
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone and Fogerty plodded through the snow together, side by
            side. They were facing the wind, which cut their faces cruelly, yet
            neither seemed to mind the bitterness of the weather.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Keep watch along the roadside,&quot; suggested Mershone;
            &quot;she may have fallen anywhere, you know. She couldn't endure
            this thing long. Poor Louise!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You were fond of her, Mr. Mershone?&quot; asked Fogerty, not
            unsympathetically.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Yes. That was why I made such a struggle to get her.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It was a mistake, sir. Provided a woman is won by force or
            trickery she's never worth getting. If she doesn't care for you it's
            better to give her up.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I know&mdash;now.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You're a bright fellow, Mershone, a clever fellow. It's a pity
            you couldn't direct your talents the right way. They'll jug you for
            this.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Never mind. The game of life isn't worth playing. I've done
            with it, and the sooner I go to the devil the better. If only I
            could be sure Louise was safe I'd toss every care&mdash;and every
            honest thought&mdash;to the winds, from this moment.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            During the silence that followed Fogerty was thoughtful. Indeed, his
            mind dwelt more upon the defeated and desperate man beside him than
            upon the waif he was searching for.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;What's been done, Mr. Mershone,&quot; he said, after a time,
            &quot;can't be helped now. The future of every man is always a
            bigger proposition than his past&mdash;whoever he may be. With your
            talents and genius you could yet make of yourself a successful and
            prosperous man, respected by the community &mdash;if you could get
            out of this miserable rut that has helped to drag you down.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;But I can't,&quot; said the other, despondently.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You can if you try. But you'll have to strike for a place a
            good way from New York. Go West, forget your past, and carve out an
            honest future under a new name and among new associates. You're
            equal to it.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone shook his head.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You forget,&quot; he said. &quot;They'll give me a jail
            sentence for this folly, as sure as fate, and that will be the end
            of me.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Not necessarily. See here, Mershone, it won't help any of
            those people to prosecute you. If the girl escapes with her life no
            real harm has been done, although you've caused a deal of
            unhappiness, in one way or another. For my part, I'd like to see you
            escape, because I'm sure this affair will be a warning to you that
            will induce you to give up all trickery in the future. Money
            wouldn't bribe me, as you know, but sympathy and good fellowship
            will. If you'll promise to skip right now, and turn over a new leaf,
            you are free.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Where could I go?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;There's a town a mile ahead of us; I can see the buildings now
            and then. You've money, for you offered it to me. I haven't any
            assistants here, I'm all alone on the job. That talk about four men
            was only a bluff. Push me over in the snow and make tracks. I'll
            tell Weldon you've escaped, and advise him not to bother you. It's
            very easy.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone stopped short, seized the detective's hand and wrung it
            gratefully.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;You're a good fellow, Fogerty. I&mdash;I thank you. But I
            can't do it. In the first place, I can't rest in peace until Louise
            is found, or I know her fate. Secondly, I'm game to give an account
            for all my deeds, now that I've played the farce out, and lost. I&mdash;I
            really haven't the ambition, Fogerty, to make a new start in life,
            and try to reform. What's the use?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            Fogerty did not reply. Perhaps he realized the case was entirely
            hopeless. But he had done what he could to save the misguided fellow
            and give him a chance, and he was sorry he had not succeeded.
          </p>
          <p>
            Meantime Arthur Weldon, almost dazed by the calamity that had
            overtaken his sweetheart, found an able assistant in his chauffeur,
            who, when the case was explained to him, developed an eager and
            intelligent interest in the chase. Fortunately they moved with the
            storm and the snow presently moderated in volume although the wind
            was still blowing a fierce gale. This gave them a better opportunity
            than the others to observe the road they followed.
          </p>
          <p>
            Jones had good eyes, and although the trail of the heavy wagon was
            lost at times he soon picked it up again and they were enabled to
            make fairly good speed.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I believe,&quot; said Arthur, presently, &quot;that the marks
            are getting clearer.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I know they are, sir,&quot; agreed Jones.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Then we've come in the right direction, for it is proof that
            the wagon was headed this way.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Quite right, sir.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            This back section was thinly settled and the occasional farm-houses
            they passed were set well back from the road. It was evident from
            the closed gates and drifted snowbanks that no teams had either left
            these places or arrived during a recent period. Arthur was
            encouraged, moreover, by the wagon ruts growing still more clear as
            they proceeded, and his excitement was great when Jones abruptly
            halted and pointed to a place where the wheels had made a turn and
            entered a farm yard.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Here's the place, sir,&quot; announced the chauffeur.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Can you get in?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It's pretty deep, sir, but I'll try.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            The snow was crisp and light, owing to the excessive cold, and the
            machine plowed through it bravely, drawing up at last to the door of
            an humble cottage.
          </p>
          <p>
            As Arthur leaped out of the car a man appeared upon the steps,
            closing the door softly behind him.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Looking for the young lady, sir?&quot; he asked.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Is she here?&quot; cried Arthur.
          </p>
          <p>
            The man placed his finger on his lips, although the wind prevented
            any sound of voices being heard within.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Gently, sir, don't make a noise&mdash;but come in.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            They entered what seemed to be a kitchen. The farmer, a man of
            advanced years, led him to a front room, and again cautioning him to
            be silent, motioned him to enter.
          </p>
          <p>
            A sheet-iron stove made the place fairly comfortable. By a window
            sat a meek-faced woman, bent over some sewing. On a couch opposite
            lay Louise, covered by a heavy shawl. She was fast asleep, her hair
            disheveled and straying over her crimson cheeks, flushed from
            exposure to the weather. Her slumber seemed the result of physical
            exhaustion, for her lips were parted and she breathed deeply.
          </p>
          <p>
            Arthur, after gazing at her for a moment with a beating-heart, for
            the mysterious actions of the old farmer had made him fear the
            worst, softly approached the couch and knelt beside the girl he
            loved, thanking; God in his inmost heart for her escape. Then he
            leaned over and pressed a kiss upon her cheek.
          </p>
          <p>
            Louise slowly opened her eyes, smiled divinely, and threw her arms
            impulsively around his neck.
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;I knew you would come for me, dear,&quot; she whispered.
          </p>

          <h2>
            CHAPTER XXIV
          </h2>
          <br />
          <p>
            A MATTER OF COURSE
          </p>
          <p>
            All explanations were barred until the girl had been tenderly taken
            to her own home and under the loving care of her mother and cousins
            had recovered to an extent from the terrible experiences she had
            undergone.
          </p>
          <p>
            Then by degrees she told them her story, and how, hearing the voice
            of her persecutor Mershone in the hall below she had become frantic
            with fear and resolved to trust herself to the mercies of the storm
            rather than submit to an interview with him. Before this she had
            decided that she could climb down the trellis, and that part of her
            flight she accomplished easily. Then she ran toward the rear of the
            premises to avoid being seen and managed to find the lane, and later
            the cross-roads. It was very cold, but her excitement and the fear
            of pursuit kept her warm until suddenly her strength failed her and
            she sank down in the snow without power to move. At this juncture
            the farmer and his wife drove by, having been on a trip to the town.
            The man sprang out and lifted her in, and the woman tenderly wrapped
            her in the robes and blankets and pillowed her head upon her
            motherly bosom. By the time they reached the farm-house she was
            quite warm again, but so exhausted that with a brief explanation
            that she was lost, but somebody would be sure to find her before
            long, she fell upon the couch and almost immediately lost
            consciousness.
          </p>
          <p>
            So Arthur found her, and one look into his eyes assured her that all
            her troubles were over.
          </p>
          <p>
            They did not prosecute Charlie Mershone, after all. Fogerty pleaded
            for him earnestly, and Uncle John pointed out that to arrest the
            young man would mean to give the whole affair to the newspapers,
            which until now had not gleaned the slightest inkling of what had
            happened. Publicity was to be avoided if possible, as it would set
            loose a thousand malicious tongues and benefit nobody. The only
            thing to be gained by prosecuting Mershone was revenge, and all were
            willing to forego that doubtful satisfaction.
          </p>
          <p>
            However, Uncle John had an interview with the young man in the
            office of the prosecuting attorney, at which Mershone was given
            permission to leave town quietly and pursue his fortunes in other
            fields. If ever he returned, or in any way molested any of the
            Merricks or his cousin Diana, he was assured that he would be
            immediately arrested and prosecuted to the full extent of the law.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mershone accepted the conditions and became an exile, passing at
            once out of the lives of those he had so deeply wronged.
          </p>
          <p>
            The joyful reunion of the lovers led to an early date being set for
            the wedding. They met all protests by pleading their fears of
            another heartrending separation, and no one ventured to oppose their
            desire.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mrs. Merrick quickly recovered her accustomed spirits during the
            excitement of those anxious weeks preceding the wedding. Cards were
            issued to &quot;the very best people in town;&quot; the <i>trousseau</i>
            involved anxiety by day and restless dreams by night&mdash;all
            eminently enjoyable; there were entertainments to be attended and
            congratulations to be received from every side.
          </p>
          <p>
            Society, suspecting nothing of the tragedy so lately enacted in
            these young lives, was especially gracious to the betrothed. Louise
            was the recipient of innumerable merry &quot;showers&quot; from her
            girl associates, and her cousins, Patsy and Beth, followed in line
            with &quot;glass showers&quot; and &quot;china showers&quot; until
            the prospective bride was stocked with enough wares to establish a
            &quot;house-furnishing emporium,&quot; as Uncle John proudly
            declared.
          </p>
          <p>
            Mr. Merrick, by this time quite reconciled and palpably pleased at
            the approaching marriage of his eldest niece, was not to be outdone
            in &quot;social stunts&quot; that might add to her happiness. He
            gave theatre parties and banquets without number, and gave them with
            the marked success that invariably attended his efforts.
          </p>
          <p>
            The evening before the wedding Uncle John and the Major claimed
            Arthur for their own, and after an hour's conference between the
            three that left the young fellow more happy and grateful than ever
            before, he was entertained at his last &quot;bachelor dinner,&quot;
            where he made a remarkable speech and was lustily cheered.
          </p>
          <p>
            Of course Beth and Patsy were the bridesmaids, and their cousin
            Kenneth Forbes came all the way from Elmhurst to be Arthur's best
            man. No one ever knew what it cost Uncle John for the wonderful
            decorations at the church and home, for the music, the banquet and
            all the other details which he himself eagerly arranged on a
            magnificent scale and claimed was a part of his &quot;wedding
            present.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            When it was all over, and the young people had driven away to begin
            the journey of life together, the little man put a loving arm around
            Beth and Patsy and said, between smiles and tears:
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Well, my dears, I've lost one niece, and that's a fact; but
            I've still two left. How long will they remain with me, I wonder?&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Dear me, Uncle John,&quot; said practical Patsy; &quot;your
            necktie's untied and dangling; like a shoestring! I hope it wasn't
            that way at the wedding.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;It was, though,&quot; declared the Major, chuckling. &quot;If
            all three of ye get married, my dears, poor Uncle John will come to
            look like a scarecrow &mdash;and all that in the face of swell
            society!&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Aren't we about through with swell society now?&quot; asked
            Mr. Merrick, anxiously. &quot;Aren't we about done with it? It
            caused all our troubles, you know.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Society,&quot; announced Beth, complacently, &quot;is an
            excellent thing in the abstract. It has its black sheep, of course;
            but I think no more than any other established class of humanity.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;Dear me!&quot; cried Uncle John; &quot;you once denounced
            society.&quot;
          </p>
          <p>
            &quot;That,&quot; said she, &quot;was before I knew anything at all
            about it.&quot;

1.F.

1.F.1.  Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm
collection.  Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may contain
"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or
corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other intellectual
property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including including checks, online payments and credit card
donations.  To donate, please visit: http://pglaf.org/donate


Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Each eBook is in a subdirectory of the same number as the eBook's
eBook number, often in several formats including plain vanilla ASCII,
compressed (zipped), HTML and others.

Corrected EDITIONS of our eBooks replace the old file and take over
the old filename and etext number.  The replaced older file is renamed.
VERSIONS based on separate sources are treated as new eBooks receiving
new filenames and etext numbers.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

<a href="http://www.gutenberg.net">http://www.gutenberg.net</a>

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.

EBooks posted prior to November 2003, with eBook numbers BELOW #10000,
are filed in directories based on their release date.  If you want to
download any of these eBooks directly, rather than using the regular
search system you may utilize the following addresses and just
download by the etext year.

<a href="http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06">http://www.ibiblio.org/gutenberg/etext06</a>

    (Or /etext 05, 04, 03, 02, 01, 00, 99,
     98, 97, 96, 95, 94, 93, 92, 92, 91 or 90)

EBooks posted since November 2003, with etext numbers OVER #10000, are
filed in a different way.  The year of a release date is no longer part
of the directory path.  The path is based on the etext number (which is
identical to the filename).  The path to the file is made up of single
digits corresponding to all but the last digit in the filename.  For
example an eBook of filename 10234 would be found at:

http://www.gutenberg.net/1/0/2/3/10234

or filename 24689 would be found at:
http://www.gutenberg.net/2/4/6/8/24689
